Influence-peddling is murky. The enormous E.U. subsidy program is built to keep the money moving. BRUSSELS \\u2014 One morning this spring, lawmakers crowded into a committee room filled with staffers, lobbyists and environmentalists to vote on a flurry of bills that would set the course for the European Union\\u2019s $65-billion-a-year farm policy. For critics of the subsidy system, one item was of special interest. It was known as the \\u201cBabis Amendment,\\u201d after Andrej Babis, the billionaire agriculturalist and prime minister of the Czech Republic. It was designed to prohibit politicians who hand out European Union farm subsidies from receiving the funds themselves. Mr. Babis is Exhibit A of how the system benefits the wealthy and connected. His government shapes agricultural subsidy policies in the Czech Republic. It also gave $42 million in European subsidies last year to his domestic companies, according to a New York Times analysis. His holdings in Germany, Hungary and Slovakia received another $7 million. \\u201cThe vote is open,\\u201d the agricultural committee chairman declared. Eleven seconds passed. Then the chairman simply said: \\u201cRejected.\\u201d Nobody read the proposal aloud. There was no debate. And nobody mentioned one relevant fact: that half of the 46 committee members had ties to the farm industry. Several lawmakers received thousands of dollars in subsidies. The Babis Amendment could have jeopardized their money, too. The European Union\\u2019s farm program is one of the largest subsidy schemes in the world. It represents 40 percent of the European budget \\u2014 money that is meant to support farmers and sustain rural communities. Yet it is opaque in key areas, with gaping shortcomings in accountability. In November, a New York Times investigation revealed that the subsidies underwrite oligarchs, mobsters and far-right populists. The Times also showed that some national leaders use the money to enrich friends, political allies and family members. Such abuses succeed in part because of a system in Brussels that favors those who earn the most from the subsidies. Not only do they play an outsized role in setting policies, they also benefit from murky conflict-of-interest rules, weak lobbying-disclosure laws and a haphazard accountability system in which cases can drag on for years even when outright fraud is discovered. Agricultural lobbyists, among the most influential in Europe, have exclusive, closed-door access to government leaders. Conflict-of-interest laws do not apply to the ministers who vote on legislation. And members of the European Parliament are not prohibited from writing the laws for the very subsidies they receive. \\u201cThe powerful people who have land and the powerful people in government work together,\\u201d said Maria Noichl, a German member of the European Parliament who sponsored the Babis Amendment. \\u201cThey both benefit from the program, and most people don\\u2019t know how it works.\\u201d Renewing the seven-year farm bill is one of the top priorities on the European agenda. Debate will intensify next year when the European Parliament and council consider whether to grant national leaders like Mr. Babis greater flexibility over how the money is spent. Internal auditors have criticized that proposal, only to face lambasting in the Parliament. For years, European leaders have been warned that the subsidies encourage corruption, harm the environment and underwrite land-grabbing. Yet major change remains difficult when so many lobbyists, lawmakers and farm officials want to keep the system intact. Andrej Babis became prime minister of the Czech Republic promising to run the state like a business. But he is often accused of running the state as if it were his business. After the end of the Cold War, Mr. Babis was among the former communists who bought up what remained of the old order. He built his empire through a relentless acquisition of farms, fertilizer companies, tractor suppliers and silos. In an industry dominated by big players, his company, Agrofert, is the biggest. \\u201cI made it from nothing,\\u201d Mr. Babis said in an interview in New York. But his companies also have benefited from policies approved by governments that he has led or served in, prompting years of investigations over conflicts of interest, even as Agrofert continued to collect subsidies. When Mr. Babis was finance minister and deputy prime minister from 2014 to 2017, small farmers complained that they lost influence on a board that monitors and helps guide national policies for handing out farm subsidies. \\u201cSo you can imagine what kind of a decision process takes place there,\\u201d said Jan Stefl, a 59-year-old Czech farmer. \\u201cIt always favors the big farmers.\\u201d Journalists then revealed that Mr. Babis had created a shell company that collected $2 million in European agricultural grants intended for small businesses. In 2017, European investigators and the Czech police recommended that he be prosecuted for fraud. But soon after that recommendation, Mr. Babis was elected prime minister. Prosecutors said they would review the investigative file. Two years later, they dropped the case. Last week, they reopened it. That is common because European fraud investigators must work with local authorities to conduct most investigations. They can recommend charges but cannot file those charges themselves. And national prosecutors act on those recommendations only 36 percent of the time, officials said this year. \\u201cWe are doing everything from our part,\\u201d a European Union spokeswoman, Mina Andreeva, said. \\u201cWe\\u2019re not here to replace every single government in the E.U.\\u201d A European prosecutor\\u2019s office is being created next year to take up such cases, though some countries opted not to participate. That includes Hungary, where the prime minister\\u2019s family and friends have reaped millions in farm subsidies. In the Czech Republic, Mr. Babis has benefited from national laws that channel more European money to his companies. One rule that purports to limit runaway subsidy spending has instead created clear advantages for his company. The rule limits farmers to one grant application a year. But a company like Agrofert, which has at least 100 domestic subsidiaries, can apply many times. Mr. Babis said in the interview that he had nothing to do with those rule changes. He said the Czech government, regardless of political party, had for years supported large-scale farming. The European Union introduced stricter conflict-of-interest rules last year, but it is still unclear whether they cover heads of government like Mr. Babis. When a Czech politician asked for clarification last year, Europe\\u2019s top budget official replied that the answer required \\u201ca case-by-case analysis.\\u201d Using a Czech conflict-of-interest law, though, European investigators audited grants paid to Mr. Babis\\u2019s business this year. They found that even though Mr. Babis had put Agrofert into two trusts, he still controlled the company and therefore violated Czech law. The auditors ordered the Czech government to return all the money paid to Agrofert from European regional development and social funds, according to a leaked report obtained by the Czech news organization Denik N and shared with The Times. Mr. Babis said that he intended to return to Agrofert once he is out of office. So, if Agrofert benefits from his government\\u2019s policies, he ultimately stands to profit. But he assailed the audits, calling them \\u201can attack on the Czech Republic\\u201d and labeling their authors incompetent. The appeals process is expected to take months. In the meantime, Mr. Babis is scheduled to join other elected national leaders on the European Council, which will meet in secret to set the European Union budget in the coming months. Czech opposition leaders have called for Mr. Babis to be excluded from that vote. One senator, Lukas Wagenknecht, urged European officials to stop paying \\u201can East-European oligarch to establish a nondemocratic autocracy.\\u201d Mr. Babis is confident that he will be exonerated. \\u201cNobody can corrupt me,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI\\u2019m quite a rich guy.\\u201d The defeat of the Babis Amendment barely registered with the most important lobbyists in the room. They had their eyes on the bigger picture: keeping the subsidy system intact, with as much money as possible. As long as there has been farm money, Copa-Cogeca, Europe\\u2019s largest organization for farmers, has swayed where it goes. European leaders have historically treated the group not as mere recipients of government money, but as partners in policymaking. Much has changed in recent decades: Environmental concerns have become a priority and farming has shrunk to 1 percent of Europe\\u2019s economy. Yet even today, Copa-Cogeca enjoys special access that would make others swoon. \\u201cOn the subsidies, they are more powerful than anyone,\\u201d said G\\u00e9rard Choplin, an agricultural policy expert and former lobbyist. Before meetings of European farm ministers, for example, the council president grants a private audience to Copa-Cogeca. That lets farm lobbyists \\u2014 and only farm lobbyists \\u2014 make their views heard before key decisions are made. When environmental groups requested similar access last year, they were rebuffed. A council representative told them that Copa\\u2019s meeting was a matter of tradition, \\u201cto facilitate an exchange of information.\\u201d Lobbyists are not required to register in Brussels and the capital is filled with events bringing them together with policymakers. Staff members from Copa-Cogeca, the agricultural company Bayer and the European Commission formed a group called the Young Food Policy Network, which hosts happy hours for government and business officials. This is not lobbying, staffers said, just people having drinks. Copa-Cogeca draws its influence largely from the national farm unions, which can cause political headaches. This year in France, farmers blockaded roads and dumped tons of manure outside the office of a member of Parliament in a protest over a trade deal. Copa-Cogeca officials make no apologies for being advocates for their industry. They say farmers are expected to hold down food prices, keep quality high and fight climate change \\u2014 all while dealing with a panoply of regulations and a shrinking farm budget. They say they have accepted years of reforms but will not accept anything that hurts the industry\\u2019s bottom line. \\u201cWe cannot be green if we are in the red,\\u201d Pekka Pesonen, the group\\u2019s secretary general, said this year. Lawmakers hear that message often. Lobbyists in Brussels are free to roam the committee room floor, and Ms. Noichl of Germany said she hesitated to talk to her colleagues there. \\u201cThere\\u2019s too many people listening,\\u201d she said. Soon after defeating the Babis Amendment, the committee prepared to vote on the full subsidy bill. It gave leaders like Mr. Babis new spending flexibility. Most important, it declared that the subsidy budget should not be cut. Before opening the vote, the committee chairman, Czeslaw Siekierski of Poland, paused for a reminder. \\u201cEuropean farmers are watching us very closely,\\u201d he told his colleagues. \\u201cAnd we must make sure that we can deliver.\\u201d The vote passed. To many, Mr. Babis has become a symbol of conflict-of-interest in the subsidy system. But lesser-known government officials also have a stake in the policies they vote on. Among the lawmakers who killed the Babis Amendment were Mairead McGuinness of Ireland, whose family received $28,000 in subsidies last year; Peter Jahr of Germany, who received $15,600; and John Stuart Agnew of Britain, who disclosed receiving between $13,000 and $66,000 from a company that is paid subsidies. Lawmakers said they saw no problem with their vote. Ms. McGuinness said the bill would have unfairly punished farmers whose family members entered politics. Mr. Jahr noted that all lawmakers are affected by some laws, like taxes. \\u201cTo a certain extent, it is inherent to the system,\\u201d he said. If the European Parliament disagrees, nobody is saying so. Its conflict-of-interest rule is vague and leaders have taken no position on whether members can vote on and receive subsidies. The responsibility for identifying conflicts, a Parliament spokeswoman said, \\u201clies primarily with the member.\\u201d So reports about lawmakers receiving subsidies become background noise. \\u201cThey vote on the money, and they and their families get the money,\\u201d Ms. Noichl said. And the members of another governing body, the Council of the European Union, are not subject to a conflict-of-interest policy at all. It comprises ministers from all 28 countries, who vote on legislation. Members of the Council are presumed to be representing their national governments, not themselves. This means that Mr. Babis\\u2019 farm minister, Miroslav Toman, can vote on subsidy policy even though his brother and father run an agricultural company that was among the biggest Czech subsidy recipients last year. \\u201cEveryone has a stake in keeping the status quo,\\u201d said Alan Matthews, a farm policy expert at Trinity College Dublin. Experts agree that one way to curtail abuses and address inequities would be to limit how much each person receives. Another would be to reconsider a formula that pays farmers based on how much land they hold. Franz Fischler, a former European agricultural commissioner, said he had tried more than 15 years ago to accomplish both. But Britain, where aristocrats own huge tracts of land, opposed the idea, Mr. Fischler said. So did Germany, home to large Soviet-style farms in what was once East Germany. When his proposal died, Mr. Fischler warned that as the European Union expanded, the subsidies would widen the gap between rich and poor. \\u201cThis is exactly where we are now,\\u201d he said. Even today, 23 of the 28 agricultural ministers who will vote on the farm bill have said they oppose a cap. \\u201cThere is no real change,\\u201d said Ms. Noichl, the German lawmaker. \\u201cNot in Europe. In Europe it\\u2019s always the same.\\u201d The European Union can and does claw back misspent money. But veteran investigators ruefully joke that often the only penalty for stealing is having to return the money. For example, European investigators say they unraveled a scheme involving a Brussels-based company that received millions of dollars to promote Bulgarian agricultural products. The firm colluded with Bulgarian companies, inflated invoices and laundered money through shell companies, according to documents and current and former officials. The authorities identified a European official, Georgios Malliaris, who received cash from the scheme, according to the officials. Mr. Malliaris did not respond to repeated messages. Investigators recommended charges two years ago against the companies and Mr. Malliaris. European officials are working to recover the money from Bulgaria, but the authorities have not prosecuted any of the companies. A sealed criminal case against Mr. Malliaris and others is winding through the Belgian judicial system, current and former officials said. Until that case is resolved, European Union officials cannot take action against Mr. Malliaris. So he remains employed and has been moved to an archiving job.

Open borders extremist and Border Angels Founder Enrique Morones told \\u201cThe Beat With Ari Melber\\u201d on MSNBC: \\u201cDonald Trump, without a doubt, is pure evil.\\u201d Then for the coup de gr\\u00e2ce, New Yorker magazine staff writer and fact checker Talia Lavin tried to ruin the career of an ICE employee over a  tattoo . She tweeted that she thought the elbow tattoo of wounded Marine veteran Justin Gaertner was a Nazi Iron Cross. Turns out, it was the symbol of his unit in Afghanistan, where this hero also lost both his legs. Lavin resigned and apologized, but still found the gall to complain about ICE, which had complained about her. \\u201cI do not think it is acceptable for a federal agency to target a private citizen for a good faith, hastily rectified error,\\u201d she  tweeted . The media piled on all week. \\u201cMorning Joe\\u201d Co-host Mika Brzezinski declared: \\u201cIf you vote for Trump, then you, the voter, you, not Donald Trump, are standing at the border, like Nazis.\\u201d That\\u2019s not too different from what  Rolling Stone  writer Ana Marie Cox thought about a rally President Trump spoke to in Minnesota. She described it as \\u201cthe way the end of democracy sounds.\\u201d And in one last sign of the journalism  apocalypse , Politico even dredged up one of Stephen Miller\\u2019s third-grade classmates to write an immigration article that was a ridiculous attempt at journalism, headlined  \\\"I Sat on the Other Side of Stephen Miller&aposs First Wall.\\\" But remember, there\\u2019s no media bias. None. Whatsoever. 2. This Is Fake News:  CNN\\u2019s Senior Media Correspondent Brian Stelter said in January that President Trump averaged calling something  \\u201cfake\\u201d at least once a day . There might be a good reason for that \\u2013 the news media. This past week, journalists delivered on two major examples of fake news. Both were so astonishingly egregious that it\\u2019s a wonder how many journalists stay employed. It\\u2019s almost as if facts don\\u2019t matter. Time magazine continued to fill recycling bins with anti-Trump material. At least  10 of its 23 covers  this year have targeted his administration. Five have depicted the president personally \\u2013 from having his hair on fire to appearing as king. The latest cover showed the president looming over a crying immigrant child. The headline read:  \\u201cWelcome to America.\\u201d  The media went bonkers, with TV outlets pitching it as news. Only it wasn\\u2019t. Turns out the doctored image that merged Trump and the little girl as if they were standing together (they weren\\u2019t) was more than a little inaccurate. The girl was indeed separated from her mom \\u2013 by about two feet. Of course, the media loved the phony image. ABC, CBS, NBC, MSNBC and CNN  all reported on it.  \\u201cCBS This Morning\\u201d Co-host John Dickerson summed up the approval, referring to it as \\u201can iconic \\u2013 a now-iconic photo taken last week captured that girl as her mother was detained.\\u201d Girl on TIME cover was not separated from mom, family says TIME Magazine's latest cover shows President Trump staring down the viral image of a little girl crying while her mother was being detained by Border Patrol. It gets worse. The girl\\u2019s mother has been  deported previously  for illegal immigration. Time\\u2019s correction of the whole affair was laughably  dishonest , admitting only that the \\u201cstory misstated what happened to the girl in the photo.\\u201d To its credit,  CBS actually fact-checked  the image. Correspondent David Begnaud warned viewers about the bogus cover: \\u201cYou may have seen the photo, you may have shared it on social media. A lot of people have. And with it, there\\u2019s been a lot of misinformation that\\u2019s been spread.\\u201d For more on that \\u201cmisinformation,\\u201d check out Daily Caller Media and Breaking News  Editor Amber Athey\\u2019s piece. That was more elaborate than what happened to former Trump Campaign Chairman Paul Manafort. But the result was much the same. As President Trump spoke on immigration during an ABC News broadcast, a graphic at the bottom of the screen falsely  proclaimed : \\u201cManafort Pleads Guilty to 5 Charges of Manslaughter.\\u201d No one has ever accused Manafort of manslaughter. The brain trust at error-prone ABC (admittedly, not brainy or trustworthy) was quick to release an apology. \\u201cThere simply is no excuse for this sort of mistake,\\u201d it wrote saying network officials \\u201care investigating\\u201d how it happened. At least, this time it wasn\\u2019t ABC News Chief Investigative Correspondent  Brian Ross  tanking the entire stock market. Washington Post Media Critic Eric Wemple crushed ABC in a story headlined:  \\u201cIn colossal error, ABC News reports that Paul Manafort \\u2018pleads guilty\\u2019 to manslaughter.\\u201d  Wemple came up with three scenarios how it happened. The first two ended by calling it \\u201ca clear scandal with disciplinary implications.\\u201d The third version added \\u201cor perhaps law-enforcement implications.\\u201d Do ABC lawyers get combat pay?\",\n          \"\\n          next\\n         Image 1 of 2 \\n          prev\\n         Image 2 of 2 AMIENS, France \\u2013  Britain&aposs Prince William and Prime Minister Theresa May, joined by ministers and ambassadors from Allied countries and a former German president, marked on Wednesday the centenary of the Battle of Amiens \\u2014 a short, bloody and decisive confrontation in northern France that heralded the end of World War I. Chilling readings by May and others recounted the Allied offensive in the eyes of those who fought, including a private, a tank captain, a commander present in the pre-dawn hours of Aug. 8, 1918 for the opening salvos of the combined air and ground assault by soldiers from Britain, Australia, Canada, the United States and France. They quickly began to push back German troops to turn the tide on the Western Front. Each country was represented at the commemoration of the battle that is widely seen as a turning point, leading to the four-month-long Hundred Days Offensive, a string of battlefield successes that led to the Allied victory consecrated three months later by the Nov. 11 Armistice. Also present was former German President Joachim Gauck. Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, addressing the gathering, hailed \\\"the cooperation without which victory was impossible.\\\" \\\"It is entirely fitting, therefore, that today that same international coalition has returned to Amiens with our former enemy, in peace and partnership,\\\" he said. A British youth choir took part in the moving ceremony under the towering columns of the vast 13th century Amiens Cathedral, which was sandbagged at the time to protect it during a series of battles in the northern Picardy region. The emblematic cathedral now contains a Chapel of the Allies. William and May lingered after the nearly 90-minute ceremony to talk with people in attendance, apparently descendants of soldiers who fought in the Battle of Amiens, as they were scheduled to do. The Battle of Amiens saw tens of thousands of soldiers pour into the region, more than 1,900 French and British aircraft and more than 500 tanks from Britain&aposs Tank Corps. The momentum from the first day of battle continued and convinced the Germans that the war was unwinnable. \\\"The effect of the war was moral and not territorial,\\\" May, in her reading, quoted then-British Prime Minister David Lloyd George as writing. French Defense Minister Florence Parly represented France at the commemoration. President Emmanuel Macron, who comes from Amiens, was not present. ___ Elaine Ganley in Paris contributed to this report.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"url\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 200,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/11/world/europe/eu-farm-subsidy-lobbying.html\",\n          \"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/immigration-policy-gives-trump-hating-media-a-new-reason-to-go-overboard-demonizing-him-and-his-team\",\n          \"https://www.foxnews.com/world/uk-prince-prime-minister-mark-centenary-of-battle-of-amiens\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"section\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 58,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"World\",\n          \"Transcript\",\n          \"middleeast\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"publication\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The Hill\",\n          \"Reuters\",\n          \"The New York Times\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":136}],"source":["# print first 5 examples in dataframe\n","df.head()"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# create new df with article author, title, and article contents\n","df_new = df[['author', 'title','article']]\n","df_new.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"id":"9koi_fdAcd7k","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1720981210931,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":189,"user":{"displayName":"Omar Alejandro Jamil","userId":"15131243146154270671"}},"outputId":"0716bba2-7464-4917-b7b1-01870afddf77"},"execution_count":137,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["             author                                              title  \\\n","0  Associated Press  Rescuers look through mud for Japan flood vict...   \n","1       Ryan Gaydos  Australian rangers trap gigantic saltwater cro...   \n","2      John Stossel  John Stossel: Are looney liberals and smug cel...   \n","3  Associated Press  UN peacekeeping force to stay, but shrink, in ...   \n","4  Associated Press  Trump tells NK's Kim to denuclearize or risk o...   \n","\n","                                             article  \n","0  \\n          next\\n         Image 1 of 2 \\n    ...  \n","1  \\n          A 15-foot, 1,300-pound saltwater c...  \n","2  \\n          While restaurant leaders reportedl...  \n","3  UNITED NATIONS â€“  U.N. peacekeepers will remai...  \n","4  close Video Trump contradicts John Bolton on N...

BRUSSELS \\u2014 One morning this spring, lawmakers crowded into a committee room filled with staffers, lobbyists and environmentalists to vote on a flurry of bills that would set the course for the European Union\\u2019s $65-billion-a-year farm policy. For critics of the subsidy system, one item was of special interest. It was known as the \\u201cBabis Amendment,\\u201d after Andrej Babis, the billionaire agriculturalist and prime minister of the Czech Republic. It was designed to prohibit politicians who hand out European Union farm subsidies from receiving the funds themselves. Mr. Babis is Exhibit A of how the system benefits the wealthy and connected. His government shapes agricultural subsidy policies in the Czech Republic. It also gave $42 million in European subsidies last year to his domestic companies, according to a New York Times analysis. His holdings in Germany, Hungary and Slovakia received another $7 million. \\u201cThe vote is open,\\u201d the agricultural committee chairman declared. Eleven seconds passed. Then the chairman simply said: \\u201cRejected.\\u201d Nobody read the proposal aloud. There was no debate. And nobody mentioned one relevant fact: that half of the 46 committee members had ties to the farm industry. Several lawmakers received thousands of dollars in subsidies. The Babis Amendment could have jeopardized their money, too. The European Union\\u2019s farm program is one of the largest subsidy schemes in the world. It represents 40 percent of the European budget \\u2014 money that is meant to support farmers and sustain rural communities. Yet it is opaque in key areas, with gaping shortcomings in accountability. In November, a New York Times investigation revealed that the subsidies underwrite oligarchs, mobsters and far-right populists. The Times also showed that some national leaders use the money to enrich friends, political allies and family members. Such abuses succeed in part because of a system in Brussels that favors those who earn the most from the subsidies. Not only do they play an outsized role in setting policies, they also benefit from murky conflict-of-interest rules, weak lobbying-disclosure laws and a haphazard accountability system in which cases can drag on for years even when outright fraud is discovered. Agricultural lobbyists, among the most influential in Europe, have exclusive, closed-door access to government leaders. Conflict-of-interest laws do not apply to the ministers who vote on legislation. And members of the European Parliament are not prohibited from writing the laws for the very subsidies they receive. \\u201cThe powerful people who have land and the powerful people in government work together,\\u201d said Maria Noichl, a German member of the European Parliament who sponsored the Babis Amendment. \\u201cThey both benefit from the program, and most people don\\u2019t know how it works.\\u201d Renewing the seven-year farm bill is one of the top priorities on the European agenda. Debate will intensify next year when the European Parliament and council consider whether to grant national leaders like Mr. Babis greater flexibility over how the money is spent. Internal auditors have criticized that proposal, only to face lambasting in the Parliament. For years, European leaders have been warned that the subsidies encourage corruption, harm the environment and underwrite land-grabbing. Yet major change remains difficult when so many lobbyists, lawmakers and farm officials want to keep the system intact. Andrej Babis became prime minister of the Czech Republic promising to run the state like a business. But he is often accused of running the state as if it were his business. After the end of the Cold War, Mr. Babis was among the former communists who bought up what remained of the old order. He built his empire through a relentless acquisition of farms, fertilizer companies, tractor suppliers and silos. In an industry dominated by big players, his company, Agrofert, is the biggest. \\u201cI made it from nothing,\\u201d Mr. Babis said in an interview in New York. But his companies also have benefited from policies approved by governments that he has led or served in, prompting years of investigations over conflicts of interest, even as Agrofert continued to collect subsidies. When Mr. Babis was finance minister and deputy prime minister from 2014 to 2017, small farmers complained that they lost influence on a board that monitors and helps guide national policies for handing out farm subsidies. \\u201cSo you can imagine what kind of a decision process takes place there,\\u201d said Jan Stefl, a 59-year-old Czech farmer. \\u201cIt always favors the big farmers.\\u201d Journalists then revealed that Mr. Babis had created a shell company that collected $2 million in European agricultural grants intended for small businesses. In 2017, European investigators and the Czech police recommended that he be prosecuted for fraud. But soon after that recommendation, Mr. Babis was elected prime minister. Prosecutors said they would review the investigative file. Two years later, they dropped the case. Last week, they reopened it. That is common because European fraud investigators must work with local authorities to conduct most investigations. They can recommend charges but cannot file those charges themselves. And national prosecutors act on those recommendations only 36 percent of the time, officials said this year. \\u201cWe are doing everything from our part,\\u201d a European Union spokeswoman, Mina Andreeva, said. \\u201cWe\\u2019re not here to replace every single government in the E.U.\\u201d A European prosecutor\\u2019s office is being created next year to take up such cases, though some countries opted not to participate. That includes Hungary, where the prime minister\\u2019s family and friends have reaped millions in farm subsidies. In the Czech Republic, Mr. Babis has benefited from national laws that channel more European money to his companies. One rule that purports to limit runaway subsidy spending has instead created clear advantages for his company. The rule limits farmers to one grant application a year. But a company like Agrofert, which has at least 100 domestic subsidiaries, can apply many times. Mr. Babis said in the interview that he had nothing to do with those rule changes. He said the Czech government, regardless of political party, had for years supported large-scale farming. The European Union introduced stricter conflict-of-interest rules last year, but it is still unclear whether they cover heads of government like Mr. Babis. When a Czech politician asked for clarification last year, Europe\\u2019s top budget official replied that the answer required \\u201ca case-by-case analysis.\\u201d Using a Czech conflict-of-interest law, though, European investigators audited grants paid to Mr. Babis\\u2019s business this year. They found that even though Mr. Babis had put Agrofert into two trusts, he still controlled the company and therefore violated Czech law. The auditors ordered the Czech government to return all the money paid to Agrofert from European regional development and social funds, according to a leaked report obtained by the Czech news organization Denik N and shared with The Times. Mr. Babis said that he intended to return to Agrofert once he is out of office. So, if Agrofert benefits from his government\\u2019s policies, he ultimately stands to profit. But he assailed the audits, calling them \\u201can attack on the Czech Republic\\u201d and labeling their authors incompetent. The appeals process is expected to take months. In the meantime, Mr. Babis is scheduled to join other elected national leaders on the European Council, which will meet in secret to set the European Union budget in the coming months. Czech opposition leaders have called for Mr. Babis to be excluded from that vote. One senator, Lukas Wagenknecht, urged European officials to stop paying \\u201can East-European oligarch to establish a nondemocratic autocracy.\\u201d Mr. Babis is confident that he will be exonerated. \\u201cNobody can corrupt me,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI\\u2019m quite a rich guy.\\u201d The defeat of the Babis Amendment barely registered with the most important lobbyists in the room. They had their eyes on the bigger picture: keeping the subsidy system intact, with as much money as possible. As long as there has been farm money, Copa-Cogeca, Europe\\u2019s largest organization for farmers, has swayed where it goes. European leaders have historically treated the group not as mere recipients of government money, but as partners in policymaking. Much has changed in recent decades: Environmental concerns have become a priority and farming has shrunk to 1 percent of Europe\\u2019s economy. Yet even today, Copa-Cogeca enjoys special access that would make others swoon. \\u201cOn the subsidies, they are more powerful than anyone,\\u201d said G\\u00e9rard Choplin, an agricultural policy expert and former lobbyist. Before meetings of European farm ministers, for example, the council president grants a private audience to Copa-Cogeca. That lets farm lobbyists \\u2014 and only farm lobbyists \\u2014 make their views heard before key decisions are made. When environmental groups requested similar access last year, they were rebuffed. A council representative told them that Copa\\u2019s meeting was a matter of tradition, \\u201cto facilitate an exchange of information.\\u201d Lobbyists are not required to register in Brussels and the capital is filled with events bringing them together with policymakers. Staff members from Copa-Cogeca, the agricultural company Bayer and the European Commission formed a group called the Young Food Policy Network, which hosts happy hours for government and business officials. This is not lobbying, staffers said, just people having drinks. Copa-Cogeca draws its influence largely from the national farm unions, which can cause political headaches. This year in France, farmers blockaded roads and dumped tons of manure outside the office of a member of Parliament in a protest over a trade deal. Copa-Cogeca officials make no apologies for being advocates for their industry. They say farmers are expected to hold down food prices, keep quality high and fight climate change \\u2014 all while dealing with a panoply of regulations and a shrinking farm budget. They say they have accepted years of reforms but will not accept anything that hurts the industry\\u2019s bottom line. \\u201cWe cannot be green if we are in the red,\\u201d Pekka Pesonen, the group\\u2019s secretary general, said this year. Lawmakers hear that message often. Lobbyists in Brussels are free to roam the committee room floor, and Ms. Noichl of Germany said she hesitated to talk to her colleagues there. \\u201cThere\\u2019s too many people listening,\\u201d she said. Soon after defeating the Babis Amendment, the committee prepared to vote on the full subsidy bill. It gave leaders like Mr. Babis new spending flexibility. Most important, it declared that the subsidy budget should not be cut. Before opening the vote, the committee chairman, Czeslaw Siekierski of Poland, paused for a reminder. \\u201cEuropean farmers are watching us very closely,\\u201d he told his colleagues. \\u201cAnd we must make sure that we can deliver.\\u201d The vote passed. To many, Mr. Babis has become a symbol of conflict-of-interest in the subsidy system. But lesser-known government officials also have a stake in the policies they vote on. Among the lawmakers who killed the Babis Amendment were Mairead McGuinness of Ireland, whose family received $28,000 in subsidies last year; Peter Jahr of Germany, who received $15,600; and John Stuart Agnew of Britain, who disclosed receiving between $13,000 and $66,000 from a company that is paid subsidies. Lawmakers said they saw no problem with their vote. Ms. McGuinness said the bill would have unfairly punished farmers whose family members entered politics. Mr. Jahr noted that all lawmakers are affected by some laws, like taxes. \\u201cTo a certain extent, it is inherent to the system,\\u201d he said. If the European Parliament disagrees, nobody is saying so. Its conflict-of-interest rule is vague and leaders have taken no position on whether members can vote on and receive subsidies. The responsibility for identifying conflicts, a Parliament spokeswoman said, \\u201clies primarily with the member.\\u201d So reports about lawmakers receiving subsidies become background noise. \\u201cThey vote on the money, and they and their families get the money,\\u201d Ms. Noichl said. And the members of another governing body, the Council of the European Union, are not subject to a conflict-of-interest policy at all. It comprises ministers from all 28 countries, who vote on legislation. Members of the Council are presumed to be representing their national governments, not themselves. This means that Mr. Babis\\u2019 farm minister, Miroslav Toman, can vote on subsidy policy even though his brother and father run an agricultural company that was among the biggest Czech subsidy recipients last year. \\u201cEveryone has a stake in keeping the status quo,\\u201d said Alan Matthews, a farm policy expert at Trinity College Dublin. Experts agree that one way to curtail abuses and address inequities would be to limit how much each person receives. Another would be to reconsider a formula that pays farmers based on how much land they hold. Franz Fischler, a former European agricultural commissioner, said he had tried more than 15 years ago to accomplish both. But Britain, where aristocrats own huge tracts of land, opposed the idea, Mr. Fischler said. So did Germany, home to large Soviet-style farms in what was once East Germany. When his proposal died, Mr. Fischler warned that as the European Union expanded, the subsidies would widen the gap between rich and poor. \\u201cThis is exactly where we are now,\\u201d he said. Even today, 23 of the 28 agricultural ministers who will vote on the farm bill have said they oppose a cap. \\u201cThere is no real change,\\u201d said Ms. Noichl, the German lawmaker. \\u201cNot in Europe. In Europe it\\u2019s always the same.\\u201d The European Union can and does claw back misspent money. But veteran investigators ruefully joke that often the only penalty for stealing is having to return the money. For example, European investigators say they unraveled a scheme involving a Brussels-based company that received millions of dollars to promote Bulgarian agricultural products. The firm colluded with Bulgarian companies, inflated invoices and laundered money through shell companies, according to documents and current and former officials. The authorities identified a European official, Georgios Malliaris, who received cash from the scheme, according to the officials. Mr. Malliaris did not respond to repeated messages. Investigators recommended charges two years ago against the companies and Mr. Malliaris. European officials are working to recover the money from Bulgaria, but the authorities have not prosecuted any of the companies. A sealed criminal case against Mr. Malliaris and others is winding through the Belgian judicial system, current and former officials said. Until that case is resolved, European Union officials cannot take action against Mr. Malliaris. So he remains employed and has been moved to an archiving job.

Media criticism of President Trump\\u2019s immigration policy reached a fever pitch this past week, as the president was demonized and called every name in the book, while some members of his administration and family were threatened and harassed. In theory, it was all part of the immigration fight. In practice, it was one more opportunity for Trump-haters to launch extreme attacks against the president and those close to him. The left hounded administration officials at  restaurants  and at  home , which thrilled Univision anchor  Jorge Ramos.  Protestors confronted Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen while she was eating at a restaurant and at her home, while White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders was  kicked out of a restaurant  because she works for President Trump.\\u00a0  Far-left  Splinter News tweeted out  the personal cell phone number of White House senior adviser Stephen Miller, and a fading Hollywood star called for the president\\u2019s youngest son to be dragged from his mother and \\u201cput in a cage with pedophiles.\\u201d That barely begins the hate-fest. Canadian comedy writer  Pat Dussault  apologized after tweeting what appeared to be a disturbing threat to Donald Trump Jr.\\u2019s 4-year-old daughter. \\u201cDon\\u2019t worry, we\\u2019re coming for Chloe, too,\\u201d he wrote. Next, there was the widespread assault on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Former \\u201cSex and the City\\u201d star Cynthia Nixon \\u2013 now seeking the Democratic nomination for governor of New York against Gov. Andrew Cuomo \\u2013 called the officers a  \\u201cterrorist organization.\\u201d The anti-American \\u201cjournalism\\u201d group Wikileaks posted a database of ICE officers. Open borders extremist and Border Angels Founder Enrique Morones told \\u201cThe Beat With Ari Melber\\u201d on MSNBC: \\u201cDonald Trump, without a doubt, is pure evil.\\u201d Then for the coup de gr\\u00e2ce, New Yorker magazine staff writer and fact checker Talia Lavin tried to ruin the career of an ICE employee over a  tattoo . She tweeted that she thought the elbow tattoo of wounded Marine veteran Justin Gaertner was a Nazi Iron Cross. Turns out, it was the symbol of his unit in Afghanistan, where this hero also lost both his legs. Lavin resigned and apologized, but still found the gall to complain about ICE, which had complained about her. \\u201cI do not think it is acceptable for a federal agency to target a private citizen for a good faith, hastily rectified error,\\u201d she  tweeted . The media piled on all week. \\u201cMorning Joe\\u201d Co-host Mika Brzezinski declared: \\u201cIf you vote for Trump, then you, the voter, you, not Donald Trump, are standing at the border, like Nazis.\\u201d That\\u2019s not too different from what  Rolling Stone  writer Ana Marie Cox thought about a rally President Trump spoke to in Minnesota. She described it as \\u201cthe way the end of democracy sounds.\\u201d And in one last sign of the journalism  apocalypse , Politico even dredged up one of Stephen Miller\\u2019s third-grade classmates to write an immigration article that was a ridiculous attempt at journalism, headlined  \\\"I Sat on the Other Side of Stephen Miller&aposs First Wall.\\\" But remember, there\\u2019s no media bias. None. Whatsoever. 2. This Is Fake News:  CNN\\u2019s Senior Media Correspondent Brian Stelter said in January that President Trump averaged calling something  \\u201cfake\\u201d at least once a day . There might be a good reason for that \\u2013 the news media. This past week, journalists delivered on two major examples of fake news. Both were so astonishingly egregious that it\\u2019s a wonder how many journalists stay employed. It\\u2019s almost as if facts don\\u2019t matter. Time magazine continued to fill recycling bins with anti-Trump material. At least  10 of its 23 covers  this year have targeted his administration. Five have depicted the president personally \\u2013 from having his hair on fire to appearing as king. The latest cover showed the president looming over a crying immigrant child. The headline read:  \\u201cWelcome to America.\\u201d  The media went bonkers, with TV outlets pitching it as news. Only it wasn\\u2019t. Turns out the doctored image that merged Trump and the little girl as if they were standing together (they weren\\u2019t) was more than a little inaccurate. The girl was indeed separated from her mom \\u2013 by about two feet. Of course, the media loved the phony image. ABC, CBS, NBC, MSNBC and CNN  all reported on it.  \\u201cCBS This Morning\\u201d Co-host John Dickerson summed up the approval, referring to it as \\u201can iconic \\u2013 a now-iconic photo taken last week captured that girl as her mother was detained.\\u201d Girl on TIME cover was not separated from mom, family says TIME Magazine's latest cover shows President Trump staring down the viral image of a little girl crying while her mother was being detained by Border Patrol. It gets worse. The girl\\u2019s mother has been  deported previously  for illegal immigration. Time\\u2019s correction of the whole affair was laughably  dishonest , admitting only that the \\u201cstory misstated what happened to the girl in the photo.\\u201d To its credit,  CBS actually fact-checked  the image. Correspondent David Begnaud warned viewers about the bogus cover: \\u201cYou may have seen the photo, you may have shared it on social media. A lot of people have. And with it, there\\u2019s been a lot of misinformation that\\u2019s been spread.\\u201d For more on that \\u201cmisinformation,\\u201d check out Daily Caller Media and Breaking News  Editor Amber Athey\\u2019s piece. That was more elaborate than what happened to former Trump Campaign Chairman Paul Manafort. But the result was much the same. As President Trump spoke on immigration during an ABC News broadcast, a graphic at the bottom of the screen falsely  proclaimed : \\u201cManafort Pleads Guilty to 5 Charges of Manslaughter.\\u201d No one has ever accused Manafort of manslaughter. The brain trust at error-prone ABC (admittedly, not brainy or trustworthy) was quick to release an apology. \\u201cThere simply is no excuse for this sort of mistake,\\u201d it wrote saying network officials \\u201care investigating\\u201d how it happened. At least, this time it wasn\\u2019t ABC News Chief Investigative Correspondent  Brian Ross  tanking the entire stock market. Washington Post Media Critic Eric Wemple crushed ABC in a story headlined:  \\u201cIn colossal error, ABC News reports that Paul Manafort \\u2018pleads guilty\\u2019 to manslaughter.\\u201d  Wemple came up with three scenarios how it happened. The first two ended by calling it \\u201ca clear scandal with disciplinary implications.\\u201d The third version added \\u201cor perhaps law-enforcement implications.\\u201d Do ABC lawyers get combat pay?\",\n          \"\\n          next\\n         Image 1 of 2 \\n          prev\\n         Image 2 of 2 AMIENS, France \\u2013  Britain&aposs Prince William and Prime Minister Theresa May, joined by ministers and ambassadors from Allied countries and a former German president, marked on Wednesday the centenary of the Battle of Amiens \\u2014 a short, bloody and decisive confrontation in northern France that heralded the end of World War I. Chilling readings by May and others recounted the Allied offensive in the eyes of those who fought, including a private, a tank captain, a commander present in the pre-dawn hours of Aug. 8, 1918 for the opening salvos of the combined air and ground assault by soldiers from Britain, Australia, Canada, the United States and France. They quickly began to push back German troops to turn the tide on the Western Front. Each country was represented at the commemoration of the battle that is widely seen as a turning point, leading to the four-month-long Hundred Days Offensive, a string of battlefield successes that led to the Allied victory consecrated three months later by the Nov. 11 Armistice. Also present was former German President Joachim Gauck. Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, addressing the gathering, hailed \\\"the cooperation without which victory was impossible.\\\" \\\"It is entirely fitting, therefore, that today that same international coalition has returned to Amiens with our former enemy, in peace and partnership,\\\" he said. A British youth choir took part in the moving ceremony under the towering columns of the vast 13th century Amiens Cathedral, which was sandbagged at the time to protect it during a series of battles in the northern Picardy region. The emblematic cathedral now contains a Chapel of the Allies. William and May lingered after the nearly 90-minute ceremony to talk with people in attendance, apparently descendants of soldiers who fought in the Battle of Amiens, as they were scheduled to do. The Battle of Amiens saw tens of thousands of soldiers pour into the region, more than 1,900 French and British aircraft and more than 500 tanks from Britain&aposs Tank Corps. The momentum from the first day of battle continued and convinced the Germans that the war was unwinnable. \\\"The effect of the war was moral and not territorial,\\\" May, in her reading, quoted then-British Prime Minister David Lloyd George as writing.
