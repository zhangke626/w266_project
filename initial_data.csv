         Image 2 of 2 HIROSHIMA, Japan –  Rescuers combed through mud-covered hillsides and near riverbanks Tuesday to look for dozens of people still missing after days of heavy rains caused flooding and mudslides in southwestern Japan, where the death toll has risen to 122. Officials and reports say more than 80 people are still unaccounted for, many of them in the hardest-hit Hiroshima area. The Fire and Disaster Management Agency said 122 people have been confirmed dead as of early Tuesday. Several days of heavy rainfall that weather officials have called historic set off flooding and landslides in widespread areas of western Japan, including Hiroshima, Okayama and Ehime prefectures. Many people started to return and check on their homes and begin cleanup after the rain stopped Monday. The government has set up a taskforce to speed up deliveries of supplies and other support for evacuation centers and residents in the region, but disrupted roads and other ground transportation have delayed shipment, raising concerns of shortages. Minoru Katayama, 86, rushed back to his home in Mabi city, in Okayama prefecture, on Monday, and found his 88-year-old wife, Chiyoko, dead on the first floor. Floodwaters rose so fast they caught the couple by surprise. ""My wife could not climb up the stairs, and nobody else was around to help us out,"" Katayama told national broadcaster NHK. His wife was among more than 20 people who were found dead in the city, where a river dike collapsed. The assessment of casualties has been difficult because of the widespread area affected. Officials in Ehime prefecture asked the central government to review a weather warning system, noting that rain warnings were issued after damage and casualties were occurring. The Japan Meteorological Agency said as much as 10 centimeters (3 inches) of rain per hour fell on large parts of southwestern Japan. Some homes were smashed, while others were tilting precariously. Rivers overflowed, turning towns into lakes and leaving dozens of people stranded on rooftops. Military paddle boats and helicopters brought people to the ground. Thousands of homes were without clean water and electricity in Hiroshima and other hard-hit areas, where many people lined up for water tanks under the scorching sun, with temperature rising as high as 34 Celsius (93 Fahrenheit), which prompted concerns about people&aposs health. Thousands have evacuated their homes. At a local elementary school in Hiroshima&aposs Yano district, dozens of residents took shelter and some shared their stories of narrow escape from the landslides and floods. Supplies such as water, blankets and cellphone chargers were provided. Ryutaro Hirakawa, 18, said he fled his house after smelling a strange odor coming from the ground, a sign of a landslide. ""The smell of soil and grass was so strong when I opened the window,"" he said. ""There were landslides."" Another resident, 82-year-old Saburo Yokoyama, said he was horrified when he saw floodwater flowing just outside his house. ""It was scary, just scary. In front of our house had become a river, and was making a huge noise,"" he said. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe canceled his planned July 11-18 trip to Europe and the Middle East to oversee the emergency response. Abe said earlier Monday that the government had dispatched 73,000 troops and emergency workers for the search and rescue effort. ___ Yamaguchi reported from Tokyo. ___ Follow Haruka Nuga on Twitter at https://twitter.com/HarukaNuga Her work can be found at https://www.apnews.com/search/haruka%20nuga",https://www.foxnews.com/world/rescuers-look-through-mud-for-japan-flood-victims-122-dead,World,Fox News

          A 15-foot, 1,300-pound saltwater croc was captured in Australia.
           (NT Department of Tourism and Culture via AP) A 15-foot saltwater crocodile was captured Monday in a region of Australia popular with tourists because it is thought to be safe from the reptiles, wildlife rangers said. The 1,300-pound predator was caught about 185 miles from the ocean and about 19 miles downstream from Katherine Gorge, a major tourist attraction outside the town of Katherine, the Northern Territory Parks and Wildlife officials said. Authorities had been hunting the giant crocodile for a decade, ranger John Burke said. “We&aposve called it a lot of things over the years because it&aposs been so hard to catch,” Burke said. 
      Rangers had been hunting the croc for a decade.
       (NT Department of Tourism and Culture via AP) “On record, this is the biggest saltwater crocodile removed from the Katherine management zone,” he said, referring to the part of the river where saltwater crocs are captured because they get too close to the tourist areas. Saltwater crocodiles are protected in Australia. Webb said the capture proved that the government protection program worked. “It&aposs worrying, but it&aposs good that they&aposve got an active program and they&aposve got active traps,” he said. The crocodile was taken to a farm outside Katherine where it’s likely to become the newest tourist attraction.

2,2018-08-01 00:00:00,2018,8.0,1,John Stossel,John Stossel: Are looney liberals and smug celebrities about to put an end to tipping?,"
          While restaurant leaders reportedly agree that Rey was a good worker, they maintain that he was fired for an “aggressive tone and nature.”
           (iStock) Union protestors and celebrity advocates have decided that waiters’ tips aren’t big enough. They are upset that in 43  states , tipped workers can be paid a lower minimum wage, as low as $2.13 an hour. Not fair! Shout celebrities like Jane Fonda, who recorded commercials saying, “That’s barely enough to buy a large cup of coffee!” As usual, those who want the government to decide that workers must be paid more insist that “women and minorities” are hurt by the market. But waitress Alcieli Felipe is a minority and a woman. She says the celebrities and politicians should butt out. Thanks to tips, Felipe says in  my new internet video , she makes “$25 an hour. By the end of the year, $48,000 to $50,000.” She understands that if government raises the minimum, “It’ll be harder for restaurants to keep the same amount of employees … (T)he busboy will be cut.” She’s right. Minimum wage laws don’t just raise salaries without cost. If they did, why not set the minimum at $100 an hour? Every time a minimum is raised, somebody loses something. “In the (San Francisco) Bay Area, you’ve got a  14 percent increase  in restaurant closures for each dollar increase in the minimum wage,” says Michael Saltsman of the Employment Policy Institute. Activists are unmoved. “The problem with tips is that they’re very inconsistent,” University of Buffalo law professor Nicole Hallett told me. Hallett is one of those activist professors who gets students to join her in “social justice” protests. “I simply don’t believe that increasing the minimum wage for tipped workers will lead to a reduction in the restaurant workforce,” she said. “Studies have shown that restaurants have been able to bear those costs.” I pointed out that last time New York raised its minimum, the city lost 270  restaurants . “Restaurants always close,” she replied. “Restaurants don’t always close,” responds Saltsman. “Yeah, there’s turnover in the industry, but what we’re doing now to an industry where there’s low profit margins, jacking up restaurant closures … Something’s not right.” The media rarely focus on those closings. We can’t interview people who are never hired; we don’t know who they are. Instead, activists lead reporters to workers who talk about struggling to pay rent. “Forty-six percent of tipped workers nationwide rely on public benefits” like food stamps, Hallett told me. I pointed out that many tipped workers are eligible for benefits because they don’t report tip income to the government. She didn’t dispute that. “Many restaurants and restaurant workers don&apost report 100 percent of their income,” she acknowledged. Hallett and other higher-minimum activists also claim that tipping should be discouraged because it causes sexual harassment. Sarah Jessica Parker, Reese Witherspoon, Natalie Portman, Jane Fonda and 12 other actresses wrote a letter urging New York’s governor to increase the minimum wage,  claiming  that “relying on tips creates a more permissive work environment where customers feel entitled to abuse women in exchange for ‘service.’” Tipping causes customers to abuse women? Saltsman says research using federal data doesn’t support that . “ Data shows some of the states that have gone down this path that the activists want, changing their tipping system, actually have a higher rate of sexual harassment.” When I pointed that out to Hallett, she replied, “Sexual harassment is complicated; no single policy is going to eliminate that problem.” So raising the minimum won’t reduce sexual harassment but will raise prices, will force some restaurants to either fire workers or close and will reduce tip income. This is supposed to help restaurant workers? Many object to being “helped.” When Maine voters increased the minimum, so many restaurant workers  protested  that the politicians reversed the decision. Alcieli Felipe doesn’t want the government “helping” her either: “We are fine. Who are those people? Have they worked in the restaurant industry?” Most haven’t. I’m a free market guy. I wonder, “Why should there be any minimum? Why can’t the employer and employee make whatever deal they want?” “That policy has been rejected,” Hallett told me, “rejected for the last hundred years. We’re not in that world.” Unfortunately, we aren’t. We live in a world where activists and government “protect” workers right out of their jobs.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/john-stossel-are-looney-liberals-and-smug-celebrities-about-to-put-an-end-to-tipping,OPINION,Fox News

4,2018-05-17 00:00:00,2018,5.0,17,Associated Press,Trump tells NK's Kim to denuclearize or risk overthrow,"close Video Trump contradicts John Bolton on North Korea policy President breaks with National Security Adviser John Bolton's comment that the U.S. would use the 'Libya model' for denuclearizing North Korea; reaction and analysis from David Lawler, world editor for Axios. WASHINGTON –  President Donald Trump laid out a stark choice for North Korea&aposs Kim Jong Un ahead of their planned summit next month: Abandon nuclear weapons and be rewarded with ""protections,"" or risk being overthrown and possible death if the arsenal remains. Trump maintained the scheduled June 12 meeting in Singapore is on track, despite the North&aposs threat Wednesday to cancel over concerns about the U.S. push to see the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. The North has argued it needs its nuclear weapons to preserve its security, and has expressed concerns about giving up its nuclear program. The North cites the example of former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, who died at the hands of rebel forces amid a popular uprising in October 2011; he had given up his nuclear program in the 2000s. National Security Adviser John Bolton explicitly cited ""the Libya model of 2003-2004"" as a basis for the North Korea talks last month, which drew personal rebuke from the North Korean government Wednesday. Trying to address the North Korean concerns, the president said if Kim were to agree to denuclearize, ""he&aposll get protections that would be very strong."" But Trump warned that failure to make a deal could have grave consequences for Kim. Mentioning what happened in Libya, Trump said, ""That model would take place if we don&apost make a deal."" ""The Libyan model isn&apost the model we have at all. In Libya we decimated that country."" Trump added. ""There was no deal to keep Gadhafi."" Trump said he is ""willing to do a lot"" to provide security guarantees to Kim. ""The best thing he could do is make a deal."" Trump also suggested China was influencing North Korea&aposs thinking regarding the summit, pointing to Kim&aposs visit to China immediately before Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Pyongyang last week to finalize the summit date and location. Trump said Thursday that nothing has changed with respect to North Korea after the warning from Pyongyang. He said North Korean officials are discussing logistical details about the meeting with the U.S. ""as if nothing happened."" In addition to threatening to pull out of the meeting with Trump, the North abruptly canceled a planned meeting with South Korean officials over joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises. Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White said Thursday that the schedule of military exercises hasn&apost changed. She added the annual exercises are long-planned, defensive in nature and meant to ensure the readiness of U.S. and South Korean forces. Exercise Max Thunder began Monday and concludes May 25. It includes aircraft from across the U.S. military services. Last year&aposs exercise included roughly 1,200 U.S. personnel and about 640 South Koreans. This year&aposs drill is similar. Speaking at an Oval Office meeting with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, Trump also said he will not discuss U.S. troop levels in South Korea during his meeting with Kim. The North has said it won&apost return to talks with Seoul due to the exercises. ___ Associated Press writer Ken Thomas contributed to this report.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/trump-tells-nks-kim-to-denuclearize-or-risk-overthrow,MILITARY,Fox News

         Image 2 of 2 JARABLUS, Syria –  Nearly 50 children orphaned by the Syrian war escaped the hell that was their hometown of Aleppo after they appeared in a distressing video and appealed for their lives as government forces moved in under a hail of fire. In the year and half since, the children and their instructors have been uprooted twice more: once to escape similar bombardment in another rebel stronghold and again when they fled a town that has been overwhelmed by people seeking shelter from Syria&aposs war. The orphanage first established in rebel-held eastern Aleppo, known as the Center for the Exceptional, has finally landed in a small house in the sleepy northern town of Jarablus, which was once a hub for Islamic State militants along the border with Turkey but has been governed by a Turkey-backed administration since 2016. More than six million people — nearly a quarter of Syria&aposs pre-war population — have been displaced inside Syria because of the war. For Aleppo&aposs orphans, the war trauma and the loss of parents were compounded by the recurrent uprooting from the only familiar place they knew. ""It was better back home. We had our toys and our home. We had a court to play in and we had a toys room, a looms area, and a hall for learning singing,"" said Yasmine Qamuz, an 11-year-old orphan whose mother is missing and whose father died of a heart condition in Aleppo. Qamuz said she left her favorite yellow doll behind in Aleppo. The fall of Aleppo came after one of the most devastating battles of the civil war, now in its eighth year. Syria&aposs largest city was for years divided between rebel- and government-controlled areas. After four years of rebel rule, the government recaptured eastern Aleppo in December 2016 after a months-long military offensive backed by Russia. The bombardment of eastern Aleppo drove residents — including the children — underground. One of the children was wounded by shrapnel when he tried to come up from the basement where they had huddled for weeks. During the siege, the orphanage put out an online video in which Qamuz, the little girl, pleaded for an exit route. Soon after, permission came for their evacuation. There was a hitch as last-minute negotiations over their destination delayed their departure. The children were encircled by gunmen for 22 hours in the buses meant to take them out of the crumbling enclave, until the deal was finally sealed. First, they went to another rebel-held town in the neighboring province of Idlib. When that came under attack, they were moved north to the town of Azaz. But soon that was hit by a huge wave of displaced people, so they had to leave again. Jarablus, a border town with just over 10,000 residents before the war, saw its population almost quadruple after the IS retreat as newly displaced Syrians moved in. Still, it remains a small town. There are few places for the children to go. The only day trip they go on is to the river banks. ""They are city children,"" said Hikmat Sheihan, one of the orphanage administrators. ""In Aleppo, they had daily visitors or events. Here, there are no events and few visitors. Those with them in school are from different environments."" Three children who lost their mother — an orphanage worker— and their father in the offensive are expected to be reunified with their extended families in Aleppo, for a short visit. ""When we left we came here because it&aposs a safe area and there is no gunfire or shelling,"" said Asmar al-Halabi, who founded the orphanage in 2015. But with the move, private donations also shrank as world attention shifted elsewhere. On a recent afternoon, the children gathered in excitement because of visitors — an Associated Press team escorted by Turkish officials. Some of the boys were attending math classes in the basement, even though school is on summer recess. Girls sat in a circle and giggled as they said they prefer the summer because it means they don&apost have to wake up early. In keeping with the schedule of the holy month of Ramadan, they read the Quran during the day and slept early to wake up for the dawn meal. Many said they were fasting. Al-Halabi, who the children refer to as Baba, or Dad, said the children still reminisce about Aleppo. ""All the kids&apos memories are of Aleppo,"" he said. ""We wish we could go back.""",https://www.foxnews.com/world/syrian-orphans-who-fled-aleppo-find-new-home,RELIGION,Fox News
6,2018-07-26 00:00:00,2018,7.0,26,Associated Press,Aide to France's Macron: Protest beating was 'huge mistake',"PARIS –  The former security aide to President Emmanuel Macron who triggered an uproar after a video showed him beating a protester acknowledged a ""huge mistake"" in attending the demonstration equipped as a police officer, but described it as a political error that ended up backfiring against the French leader. Authorities have opened a judicial investigation into Alexandre Benalla, who was fired last week, and his office was searched on Wednesday. Le Monde newspaper published the interview Thursday with Benalla, who had shaved his beard to be less recognizable. Macron&aposs office has been criticized for not disclosing the accusations weeks ago and the way it handled them. The French leader said Tuesday at a private gathering of his centrist party that he alone was responsible. He has not spoken publicly to lawmakers during a week of televised parliamentary sessions, but when pressed by journalists on Wednesday he downplayed the uproar over Benalla&aposs actions. ""He made a real, serious error which I felt was a personal betrayal and told him so. He was punished for this error and then resumed his work. When he made a second error he was more severely punished, as had been expected,"" Macron said. ""Everyone makes mistakes, the response has to be proportional."" France&aposs parliament has opened up a series of inquiries into Benalla&aposs role within the Macron administration and his request to carry firearms. The 26-year-old claimed credit for choosing the site where Macron formally claimed the presidency — the Louvre palace — and said his job was to take care of Macron&aposs private life. He can be seen in dozens of photos, at Macron&aposs side or just behind him. ""I don&apost have the sense that I betrayed the president; I have the sense that I made a huge mistake, to have committed an error,"" Benalla said. ""But this error, it&aposs more from a political point of view: I never should have gone to that protest as an observer and then, perhaps, I should have stayed back."" Benalla said targeting him has been a means to hurt Macron. ""I am the weak link,"" he said. Benalla had considered himself a crucial part of Macron&aposs detail, and has criticized his official security, the equivalent of the American Secret Service. ""They aren&apost at all involved in organization. They only handle security,"" he told Le Monde. Earlier this week, speaking to lawmakers, Paris Police Chief Michel Delpuech denounced what he called ""unhealthy cronyism"" to explain Benalla&aposs apparent sway within France&aposs security apparatus. However, both the interior minister and the police chief said Benalla was among some 40 people present in the command room on the night of May 1, watching video screens of the police cleanup operation of the protests.",https://www.foxnews.com/world/aide-to-frances-macron-protest-beating-was-huge-mistake,World,Fox News
7,2018-06-28 00:00:00,2018,6.0,28,Associated Press,Communist rebels tell Philippine leader: No more talks,"MANILA, Philippines –  A Philippine communist rebel leader said Thursday that the insurgents can no longer hold peace talks with President Rodrigo Duterte&aposs administration and that it is better to help oust him and negotiate with his successor. Jose Maria Sison said Duterte wants the guerrillas to surrender without addressing the social ills that have inflamed one of Asia&aposs longest communist rebellions. He criticized the president for being ""subservient to U.S. imperialism"" and blamed him for the ""traitorous sellout"" of disputed South China Sea territories to China. After preliminary talks, both sides agreed to a new temporary cease-fire on June 21, with peace talks to resume on Thursday in Norway, which has been brokering the decades-long negotiations. But Duterte delayed the resumption indefinitely, antagonizing the guerrillas. ""Based on the implications drawn from the current impasse,"" the rebel front involved in the talks, the National Democratic Front of the Philippines, ""can no longer negotiate with a government of the Republic of the Philippines that is headed by Duterte,"" Sison said. ""It is relatively easier and more productive for the National Democratic Front of the Philippines to participate in the oust-Duterte movement and to prepare for peace negotiations with the prospective administration that replaces the Duterte regime,"" said Sison, the founder of the Communist Party of the Philippines who has been in exile in the Dutch city of Utrecht for more than three decades. His comments were posted on the front&aposs website. Duterte shrugged off the threat and said he was ready to continue fighting the insurgents. The rural rebellion has raged for nearly half a century. ""If they&aposre not willing to talk to me, that&aposs fine. I have no problem so we continue with the war. Anyway, we&aposve been there for 50 years, what if we add another 30 years?"" Duterte told reporters when asked for a reaction. The rebellion, which has raged since 1969, has left about 40,000 combatants and civilians dead and has stunted economic development in the impoverished countryside. The military says a few thousand Maoist insurgents are continuing to wage the insurgency. When he took power in 2016, Duterte resumed peace talks with the guerrillas but canceled the negotiations last year to protest continued guerrilla attacks on troops, and signed an order declaring the rebel group a terrorist organization. The rebels suspect Duterte delayed the talks&apos resumption to allow government forces to proceed with counterinsurgency attacks and to force the rebels to shift the venue of the talks from Europe to Manila, where Sison said the guerrillas could be subjected to surveillance and harassment. The volatile president has invited Sison to return home for the talks, assuring him of his safety. Duterte has remained popular despite alarm over his bloody crackdown on illegal drugs and growing condemnation of his often expletive-laden speeches in the largely Roman Catholic country, including one last week in which he called God ""stupid."" The largest protests against Duterte have been a fraction of the massive rallies that ousted dictator Ferdinand Marcos in 1986 and President Joseph Estrada in 2001. ""He stands isolated and ripe for ouster by the broad united front of patriotic and democratic forces,"" Sison said, but Duterte rejected that prospect. ""Which forces will join him? Let us see,"" Duterte said.",https://www.foxnews.com/world/communist-rebels-tell-philippine-leader-no-more-talks,World,Fox News

         Image 2 of 2 SINGAPORE –  President Donald Trump cast his Tuesday summit with North Korea&aposs Kim Jong Un as a ""one-time shot"" for the autocratic leader to ditch his nuclear weapons and enter the community of nations, saying he would know within moments if Kim is serious about the talks. Trump said Saturday he was embarking on a ""mission of peace,"" as he departed the Group of Seven meeting in Canada to fly to the summit site in Singapore. Saying he has a ""clear objective in mind"" to convince Kim to abandon his nuclear program in exchange for unspecified ""protections"" from the U.S., Trump acknowledged that the direction of the high-stakes meeting is unpredictable, adding it ""will always be spur of the moment."" ""It&aposs unknown territory in the truest sense, but I really feel confident,"" he told reporters. ""I feel that Kim Jong Un wants to do something great for his people and he has that opportunity and he won&apost have that opportunity again."" ""It&aposs a one-time shot and I think it&aposs going to work out very well,"" he said. The meeting will be the first between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader. Unlike traditional summits between heads of state, where most of the work is completed in advance of a photo-op, U.S. officials say the only thing certain ahead of these talks will be their unpredictability. Raising expectations in advance of the meeting, Trump said the outcome will rely heavily on his own instincts. The U.S. president, who prides himself on his deal-making prowess, said he will know ""within the first minute"" of meeting Kim whether the North Korean leader is serious about the nuclear negotiations. ""I think I&aposll know pretty quickly whether or not, in my opinion, something positive will happen. And if I think it won&apost happen, I&aposm not going to waste my time. I don&apost want to waste his time,"" Trump said. ""This is a leader who really is an unknown personality,"" Trump added of Kim. ""People don&apost know much about him. I think that he&aposs going to surprise on the upside, very much on the upside."" The Kim sit-down comes as Trump&aposs international negotiating skills have faced their toughest tests to date with mixed results. Tensions flared at the G-7 summit between Trump and U.S. allies over his protectionist economic policies and decisions to exit the Iran nuclear deal and Paris climate accord. Trump rated his relationships with U.S. partners as ""a 10,"" though erstwhile allies spent much of the weekend directly challenging Trump&aposs policy positions. As he looks to the Kim meeting, Trump is taking a high-stakes risk in hopes of containing the increasingly challenging national security threats from North Korea&aposs advanced nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Seeing Nobel Peace Prize laurels and eyeing potential to show up his critics at home and abroad, Trump is granting Kim the international legitimacy he&aposs long sought in hopes of securing a legacy-defining accord. ""He could take that nation with those great people and truly make it great,"" Trump said. ""That&aposs why I feel positive, because it makes so much sense."" Trump also praised the North Koreans, saying they have been ""really working very well with us"" during preparations for the summit, even though Trump had canceled the summit last month following a recent period of what he called ""tremendous anger and open hostility"" from the North Korean government. But then Trump did a quick pivot, signaling almost immediately after scrapping the meeting that he was open to going ahead with it after all. Delegations from both countries then launched into a frenetic period of negotiations that are expected to culminate with Tuesday&aposs meeting. ""So far, so good. We&aposre going to have to see what happens. I very much look forward to it,"" Trump said. Still, questions remain about what a deal on the North&aposs nuclear weapons could look like. Trump has said he believes Kim would agree to denuclearization — and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Thursday he had received Kim&aposs personal assurances to that effect — but the two countries have offered differing visions of what that would entail. Despite Kim&aposs apparent eagerness for a summit with Trump, there are doubts that he would fully relinquish his nuclear arsenal, which he may see as his guarantee of survival. U.S. defense and intelligence officials have assessed the North to be on the threshold of having the capability to strike anywhere in the continental U.S. with a nuclear-tipped missile — a capacity that Trump and other U.S. officials have said they would not tolerate. Trump reiterated his promise Saturday that the U.S. ""will watch over and we&aposll protect"" Kim and his government in return for him giving up the nuclear program. He also indicated that South Korea, China and Japan would be prepared to invest in the North to boost its besieged economy. ___ Lucey reported from La Malbaie, Quebec.

He died there after being beaten and denied medical care. Ever since then, Bill Browder has campaigned to punish Russia. And he says his efforts have made him Vladimir Putin&aposs number-one foreign enemy. Bill Browder joins us now from an undisclosed location this evening. Bill, good evening once again to you. What was your reaction when you heard Vladimir Putin mention your name? I know you spoke about that here the other night. But then, how about what you heard at the White House today? BILL BROWDER, CO-FOUNDER, HERMITAGE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: I was absolutely appalled by what I heard at the White House today. You know, what Vladimir Putin wants, we know he&aposs a bad guy. We know he&aposs coming after me because -- yes, we&aposre -- because of the Magnitsky Act. But to have -- to have the White House press secretary saying that they haven&apost decisively ruled it out right off the bat and they&aposre considering this unseemly trade of me and a bunch of good American people for these Russian spies is absolutely appalling and ridiculous. MACCALLUM: The Magnitsky Act was passed by Congress and it put sanctions on Vladimir Putin, on many -- on many of his wealthiest friends, in terms of what travel they could have. This has irritated him to no end and he wants it lifted. And, in fact, that was part of the reason that Natalia Veselnitskaya was in New York to try to get the Magnitsky Act lifted. It also has to do with some adoption rules, that&aposs part of the larger picture of it. But they very much want that overturned, and he&aposs obviously very angry with you. I wonder if you, you know took any comfort from what you heard later today from the State Department here&aposs Heather Nauert. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HEATHER NAUERT, SPOKESPERSON, UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF STATE: I can&apost answer on behalf of the White House with regard to that, but what I can tell you is that the overall assertions that have come out of the Russian government are absolutely absurd. The fact that they want to question 11 American citizens and the assertions that the Russian government is making about those American citizens, we do not stand by those assertions --  (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Does that make you feel any better? BROWDER: Well, I feel better knowing -- I mean, that by itself doesn&apost make me feel better because the President of the United States is still ""considering"" it. But at the end of the day, I&aposm highly confident that nothing will happen. I mean, and just to dig a little deeper into this whole thing, just so everyone understands what&aposs going on. The people that Vladimir Putin, wants to have interviewed by his Russian secret police are Mike McFaul, the former U.S. ambassador to Russia. Kyle Parker, a senior congressional staff member who wrote the Magnitsky Act. Bob Otto, a senior official in the State Department. And then, in addition to that, there are three special agents of the Department of Homeland Security who have had been conducting investigations into Russian money laundering in New York buying property. And so, the idea that the White House, the Donald Trump would be considering handing these people over, and me over to the Russians is just appalling, it&aposs effectively treason to hand over patriotic people who&aposve been trying to do the right thing. And they better come out quickly and walk that one back. Otherwise, this is -- this is truly a litmus test for the Trump administration. MACCALLUM: Yes. Ambassador McFaul has said that he -- you know, hopes that there is immediate pushback publicly to this idea. How -- do you think that -- you know, do you think the president is very familiar with your case and really understands the whole thing? BROWDER: Well, apparently, he spent a quite a bit of time in his private meeting discussing me and my case. So, he shouldn&apost be unfamiliar with it at this point. MACCALLUM: And the Russian officials, what do you -- what do you hearing about what their understanding is of what may or may not have been discussed in the closed-door meeting? BROWDER: Well, the Russian government has made a very clear announcement, saying here is a list of people that they want to interrogate in the United States and it consists of me, and it consists of a bunch of these people I just mentioned. MACCALLUM: Yes. BROWDER: And they are very clear about it. And the one thing I should point out to you that these -- the story that Vladimir Putin told at the Helsinki summit press conference is the same story that Natalia Veselnitskaya told in the Trump Tower meeting in June of 2016. And so, this has been something that Putin has been sort of peddling through different -- through different mediums for a long time, and now just reached his own mouth to the mouth of -- to the years of the most powerful man in the free world, Donald Trump. MACCALLUM: Yes. Well, as of right now, the White House says that they thought it was a -- you know, an interesting idea. And that was as far as they went with it, they made no commitment to anything. So, it is a quite extraordinary story, and we&aposll follow it very closely. Bill, thanks again for being here tonight. Good to see you. BROWDER: Thank you. MACCALLUM: Take care in your undisclosed location. All right. So, President Trump, hitting back at critics today saying that no one has been tougher on Russia than his administration. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And we&aposre doing very well. Probably, as well as anybody has ever done with the Russia, and there&aposs been no president ever as tough as I have been on Russia. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Here now, David Bossie, Trump 2016 campaign, deputy campaign manager, and president of citizens united and a Fox News contributor. And Austan Goolsbee, a former chief economic adviser to President Obama, an economics professor at the University of Chicago. Gentlemen, welcome to both of you. Good to have you both here. DAVID BOSSIE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Thanks for having me. MACCALLUM: David, let me start with you. I just want to get your reaction to my discussion with Bill Browder. Doesn&apost it seem odd to you that the White House hasn&apost unequivocally come out and said, ""That&aposs never going to happen, we&aposre not sending anyone to you and your investigators are not going to speak to these people."" BOSSIE: Well, that&aposs exactly what it sounded like Heather Nauert just said, and she speaks for the State Department. So, I don&apost -- I didn&apost see much daylight in there. MACCALLUM: Well, she said she couldn&apost speak for the White House. I&aposm just -- you know, curious why if -- you know, has been not so clear from the president or from the White House? Why would there be any hesitation in that? BOSSIE: You know, the Brower case is new for me. And I could just tell you that the President Trump would never agree to allow Americans to be questioned. MACCALLUM: Yes. BOSSIE: Or you God forbid sent over to Russia. I think that&aposs not even on the table, I would expect that it&aposs not. MACCALLUM: And Browder&aposs actually a British citizen, he was an American businessman at the time. But I mean, based on everything we&aposve seen from this president who has brought hostages back from other countries, he&aposs made that a priority. It doesn&apost seem to line up with the way that we&aposve seen him working on these sorts of things and that&aposs why I guess it&aposs raising a number of questions tonight. With regard to the president&aposs statement that he has been tougher than former presidents on the Soviet Union when it comes to the actions, Austan, what do you think about that? AUSTAN GOOLSBEE, FORMER ECONOMIC ADVISER TO BARACK OBAMA: I mean, I assume he was kidding or he didn&apost know what he was talking about, because that&aposs obviously frame of face should not true at all. MACCALLUM: How so? How so? GOOLSBEE: Well, let&aposs walk through the Christmas list of what Vladimir Putin has wanted for the last 10 years in the West, Donald Trump, has actively done the bidding that Vladimir Putin has wanted. He&aposs undermined NATO in a very significant way. You just saw it today --  (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: How has he done that he added 30 -- he push them to add $35 to $40 billion dollars in defense spending at NATO? BOSSIE: No, no, come on, Austan. The opposite. GOOLSBEE: OK, let&aposs talk about number one. MACCALLUM: Yes. GOOLSBEE: Today, the president&aposs saying that maybe we wouldn&apost have to come to the defense of a country in NATO like Montenegro if it was too small and we didn&apost want to do so. That&aposs the very core agreement of NATO. It completely undermines NATO. (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: David, you&aposre shaking your head. I&aposm going to go one by one here. Because that --  GOOLSBEE: It&aposs not me saying it, the leaders of the NATO country said that he undermined it. BOSSIE: The NATO --  MACCALLUM: David, you want to weigh in on that? BOSSIE: Barack Obama allowed the Russians to meddle. Barack Obama allowed them to invade Crimea. Barack Obama -- you can laugh. GOOLSBEE: Oh, boy. BOSSIE: Barack Obama allowed the Syrians to gasp children. The red line that Barack Obama talked about was not accurate. He&aposs -- he lied to the American people and he&aposd let Putin do whatever he wanted. That&aposs the -- those are the facts. MACCALLUM: You know, when you look, you know --  (CROSSTALK) GOOLSBEE: Let me -- David, do you think this was a successful summit? MACCALLUM: Hold on Austan. GOOLSBEE: He went to a summit in which he is talking about potentially extraditing the U.S. -- the former U.S. ambassador to Russia. BOSSIE: That&aposs not true. It&aposs not true. GOOLSBEE: To Russia. BOSSIE: It&aposs not true. MACCALLUM: All right. Well, hold on guys. (CROSSTALK) GOOLSBEE: You just -- look, I don&apost know what to tell you other than what he himself said. MACCALLUM: Yes, and hold on. Austan, no, but, Austan, Austan -- you know, just take a breath for one second. GOOLSBEE: OK. MACCALLUM: You know, in terms of actual facts on the ground, and what -- and what we have seen happen, this president gave lethal aid to the Ukraine. President Obama symptom MREs. You know, so you can talk in broad terms about being dissatisfied with the -- with the attitude that you saw in Helsinki, and I think, you would find a lot of people that would agree with that. But we have to -- you know, deal in the actual facts on the ground. (CROSSTALK) GOOLSBEE: OK, what&aposs (INAUDIBLE) couple of specifics. MACCALLUM: President Obama said that he would -- he would consider easing up on the missile shield. Can you imagine how that felt to the Eastern European countries when they heard that? And in fact, the missile shield is still in the works and planned to be done by 2020 under this president? GOOLSBEE: Let&aposs walk through specific if you&aposd like to. MACCALLUM: OK. The U.S. Congress passed a sanctions on Russia to punish them for their behavior. The Trump administration has actively not enforced the sanctions. BOSSIE: The sanctions are still all on. GOOLSBEE: And they -- when first said they were going to evict the Russian diplomats, and then turned around and said that they would allow the Russians to replace those diplomats with other diplomats. So, when you&aposre saying that the president is being the toughest president on Russia, it&aposs obviously not true, you don&apost have to make claims that are completely over the top falls in order to say that he&aposs doing a --  (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: I&aposm just literally going by the facts. The money spent, the strengthening of NATO, the increase in aid to Ukraine, you know, if you&aposre -- if you&aposre one of those people --  (CROSSTALK) GOOLSBEE: When you say he strengthen NATO with the leaders of our NATO allies universally agree that he undermined NATO and they been extremely disturb. BOSSIE: Theresa May. GOOLSBEE: So, why is it that you say that strengthening NATO? MACCALLUM: All right. I been hear a lot. So, David, I want to give you the final thought here. David, go ahead. BOSSIE: Look, Trump derangement syndrome is a real thing. We see this now. We see that Brennan, the Obama CIA director who is responsible for allowing the meddling in the Syrian gassing of children. This guy voted for a communist, now we find out. We have problems that President Trump inherited that he is trying to fix. The Obama administration and their ilk are doing everything they can to undermine him. They lie, they will cheat, they will steal, they want to basically, eliminate the election of November of 2016. That&aposs all they think about, that&aposs all they can do. MACCALLUM: Alright, guys. Thanks, good debate. Good to have you both here tonight. So, still, to come, Mandalay Bay has been criticized for allowing Stephen Paddock to load an enormous amount of firepower into his room there before unleashing it on hundreds of innocent people below. But now, Mandalay Bay is suing the victims. A heated debate coming up tonight. Plus, prosecutors say that she offered sex in return for a job here in the United States and then, proceeded to infiltrate GOP circles. What we are now learning tonight about the woman known as Maria Butina. Do you think that&aposs her real name? Michael Isikoff is joining me with some of what he&aposs done. He is been writing about her actually for a long time, he&aposs up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: She once appeared in GQ Russia back in 2014. Where&aposs -- let&aposs take a look at that picture. There she is in GQ Russia with a couple of guns and a fancy leather jacket. But today she was wearing an orange jumpsuit and she pled not guilty to charges of acting as an agent of a foreign government. She&aposs going to be held in jail. The judge says that she has no ties to America and therefore she is a serious flight risk saying that she could hop into any Russian diplomatic vehicle and she would be out of their hands.  So the prosecutors say that this 29-year-old allegedly offered to have sex with an unnamed individual in return for a job in the United States and that she gained access to an extensive network of U.S. persons to influence political activities in the United States by living with and at one point and none of the people in this picture are implicated in this so let&aposs take them off the camera. But there is a suggestion that she had a relationship with an individual and may have moved in with someone in order to gain access as well. So here is Jack Barsky former KGB Agent on the story last night when he asked -- when I asked him if he believed that she is indeed a Russian spy.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Is she is a spy, what we would call a spy?  JACK BARSKY, FORMER KGB AGENT: I would think so, albeit most likely in an amateur. I&aposm calling her an amateur, I also have to compliment her because he got a lot further than I as a trained professional got. I mean, she made contact with a lot of people that are and would be of interest to Russia.  (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: So that, of course, is what spies tried to do. Remember Anna Chapman who even kind of looks a little bit like Maria Butina and the ring of Russian spies who were caught back in 2010. Their story was the basis for the series The Americans. Michael Isikoff is the Chief Investigative Correspondent at Yahoo! News, and Co-Author of Russian Roulette. Michael, welcome back to the program. You wrote about Maria Butina in your book. Were you surprised to hear that she had been arrested?  MICHAEL ISIKOFF, CHIEF INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT, YAHOO! NEWS: Not really. I mean, Maria Butina, by the way, is how it&aposs pronounced --  MACCALLUM: Butina. Thank you. ISIKOFF: -- has been on my radar screen and a number of others for quite some time you know, during the 2016 campaign. She kept showing up at various events. She was photographed with Scott Walker at an NRA event shortly after he announced. And also -- and I we do write about this in Russian Roulette, just a few weeks after Donald Trump declared his candidacy for president she showed up at an event. He was speaking out in Las Vegas Trump called on her during a Q&A session and she asked about --  MACCALLUM: We have that, Michael. Let me just jump in for one second because we can show that. ISIKOFF: Sure.  MACCALLUM: Let&aposs play that.  ISIKOFF: Sure. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARIA BUTINA, RUSSIAN SPY: Do you want to continue the politics of sanctions that are damaging of both economy?  TRUMP: I believe I would get along very nicely with Putin, OK? And I mean, where we have the strength. I don&apost think you&aposd need the sanctions. I think that we would get along very, very well.  (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: I mean, she was clearly doing her job. She was getting --  ISIKOFF: She was doing her job -- right. And look, Russia sanctions was hardly at the forefront of the American political dialogue at that moment. That&aposs not what Republican candidates were talking much about but she got Trump on the record saying he&aposd do away with sanctions. That was some --  MACCALLUM: But President Obama was pressing sanctions at that point, right? ISIKOFF: Oh, well, he had already imposed sanctions, yes. And there&aposs -- Trump is saying if you elect me you wouldn&apost need the sanctions.  MACCALLUM: All right, let&aposs talk a little bit about the back channels that she was trying to establish and whether or not your -- from your reporting she was able to really get anywhere with that. And part of the investigation is whether or not there was funneling of money. I mean, in my mind she&aposs sort of like the human expression of you know of a bot or a tweet or all of the other efforts that they made. She&aposs a much more traditional expression of that. In fact, over the last, you know decade they&aposve arrested 20 spies who have been doing exactly what she was trying to do.  ISIKOFF: Right, right. Look, she was there as we write in the book, I mean, she surprised a lot of people because she kept showing up at NRA conventions, at CPAC conferences, at national prayer breakfasts, and you know there are a number of people who kept wondering why is this woman always here? What is she after? We --- there&aposs a Republican lobbyist who she was sort of coming on to and this lobbyist was wondering what&aposs going on here? Why is this Russian woman you know, trying to befriend me and being so (INAUDIBLE) of what I have to say? MACCALLUM: Yes, I wonder why. I wonder what she might possibly want. Oh my god. Yes.  ISIKOFF: But look, there&aposs a serious part to this story and that is her handler, her boss, and that&aposs that guy Alexander Torshin. He is a Russian central banker, deputy governor was a high-level official in the in the Duma, in Putin&aposs party, and an accused money launderer. The Spanish national police had wiretap on him talking to the head of an organ -- Russian organized crime gang leader in Spain in which their leader is talking about him as El Padrino. Torshin is the real target here. He&aposs the guy you got a look for. MACCALLUM: He&aposs the guy in the picture that we&aposre showing right now next to her. Michael, thank you. Good to see you tonight.  ISIKOFF: Sure enough. Any time.  MACCALLUM: So New Jersey, Senator Bob Menendez has been plagued by scandal and now his New Jersey Senate race is looking like it could actually become a toss-up. And 58 concert goers massacred, hundreds of people injured, and now Mandalay Bay is turning the tables on the Las Vegas victims. One of the survivors is up next.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROBERT EGLET, ATTORNEY FOR LAS VEGAS VICTIMS: They have no interest whatsoever in the victims. They haven&apost -- what their number one and only priority is their money.  (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: Fifty-eight people were murdered and more than 500 were injured in the Las Vegas massacre last October. And now more than 1,000 survivors of the deadliest shooting in American history are being sued by MGM Resorts. The strange twist is sparking in major backlash. Is this heartless or practical or maybe both? Jonathan Hunt is live in our West Coast Newsroom with the story. Hi, Jonathan! JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CHIEF CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Martha! It certainly seems odd on the face of it that the company would sue victims but it&aposs all about MGM protecting itself from what could potentially be a series of devastating financial claims. The company says it has ""no liability of any kind to defendants."" Those defendants being some of the hundreds of people who were shocked, wounded, and traumatized that terrible night when a gunman open fire from Mandalay Bay. MGM sight say 2002 federal act that gives liability protection to any company that uses ""anti-terrorism technology"" or services that can ""help prevent and respond to mass violence.""  MGM says it&aposs protected from liability because it used a security company certified by the Department of Homeland Security. And in a statement, MGM added ""years of drawn out litigation and hearings are not in the best interest of victims, the community and those still healing."" Now, the act MGM is relying on here cost in the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks. The FBI has not called the Vegas shootings as an act of terrorism and in fact still hasn&apost found a motive behind the massacre. Victims and their lawyers are outraged.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) EGLET: This is the most reprehensible conduct by a defendant under circumstances like this I&aposve ever witnessed in more than 30 years. (END VIDEO CLIP) HUNT: And they argue that as Stephen Paddock brought his huge arsenal of weapons into the Mandalay Bay, MGM should have seen the warning signs and should not be protected legally by that 2002 federal safety act.  EGLET: It wasn&apost meant to provide immunity for a hotel-casino who had woefully inefficient security process that didn&apost you know, all the bells and whistles that were going off that they didn&apost catch. HUNT: Now, the courts will decide the legal issues. The court of public opinion, Martha, seems to have rolled already against MGM. Martha? MACCALLUM: It would be damaging as well. Thank you very much, Jonathan. Brian Claypool, an attorney who was there the night of the massacre, he represents more than 75 of the survivors and Mark Eiglarsh a Criminal Defense Attorney and former Prosecutor.  Gentlemen, welcome, both of you. Mark, you were there. We talked shortly after that night about how horrific it was for you. You know, how does MGM turn lawsuits against these victims and get away with it?  BRIAN CLAYPOOL, DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Hi, Martha. Thanks for having me back. Yes, we talked right after the shooting and I will tell you that the announcement of these lawsuits against the victims of the Vegas shooting has re-victimized and re-traumatized everybody that was part of that shooting, including myself.  My question to MGM is how deep into the swamp do they want to go by suing victims? Now how low do they want to kick the victims? In my opinion, both as a victim of the shooting and a lawyer. And actually I&aposm co-counseling with Robert Eglet on these cases.  I mean, this is a bullying tactic and an intimidation tactic, Martha, to dissuade or discourage these victims from filing this lawsuit. MACCALLUM: Yes. CLAYPOOL: Plain and simple. They didn&apost have to do this.  MACCALLUM: Mark, I can understand if MGM thinks that, you know, they can win this suit, but suing the victims? What are they suing them for?  MARK EIGLARSH, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: A P.R. nightmare. I will not defend them on P.R. grounds at all. My heart goes out to the victims and I can understand why Brian and the others are feeling angry.  However, Brian is a tremendous trial lawyer, he knows that your job when you&aposre defending someone is to do everything you possibly can to win. And in this particular case they cite a statute that seems to be created for this very scenario.  They didn&apost hire Justin Bieber&aposs bodyguards or a couple of hells angels. They hired a company that was certified by the Department of Homeland Security in the exact acts that are protected underneath the statute. I&aposm not sure how a judge doesn&apost grant this.  (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: All right. But let me ask you this. Because after this horrific night we talked about the security that other casinos have in place in Las Vegas and the Wynn Casino as I remember had much tougher security in terms of what you can bring into those rooms and how long you can let them -- you know, no one enter your room for days and days.  So if you can prove -- can you prove, Brian, that they were negligent because other resorts have handled it much better?  CLAYPOOL: You can do that and you can also the way we are going to do it also is, for example, a couple weeks ago, there was evidence of three years ago, convicted felon is in a hotel room at the Mandalay Bay with mass weapons.  So we can use -- we can use prior reports of crime at all the MGM casinos and try to get an evidence of other crime occurring on the property from other casinos to prove negligence. But one thing I want to respond to Mark with-- (CROSSTALK) EIGLARSH: Martha? CLAYPOOL: -- is I don&apost think this is -- this is not a slam dunk. Because the spirit of this 2002 law, Martha, was to prevent terrorism. The definition of terrorism is violence for a political gain. This had nothing to do with terrorism and the last one I want to make is-- (CROSSTALK)  EIGLARSH: But that&aposs not accurate.  CLAYPOOL: Even is a judge -- but even if -- but listen, Martha. MACCALLUM: Mark, last point. Go ahead. CLAYPOOL: Even if a judge does say this is terrorism-- EIGLARSH: The definition of terrorism, Brian-- MACCALLUM: Go ahead, Mark. Go ahead. EIGLARSH: Brian? CLAYPOOL: Even if -- let me finish.  EIGLARSH: The definition of terrorism in this scenario is any unlawful act, and that&aposs what this was, inside the United States, which it was, that causes mass destruction, injury or other loss. It seems to fit exactly the definition, Brian, as much as I feel for you and your client legally the judge will not consider the motion sympathy.  (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: All right. We got to leave it there, guys.  CLAYPOOL: Mark -- Mark? MACCALLUM: Gentlemen, thank you. CLAYPOOL: You can&apost-- MACCALLUM: We got to leave it there. We&aposll pick it up. We&aposll stay on it. Good to see you both tonight. Thank you very much.  So coming up, more Democrats run cities like Chicago pushing some usual liberal policies for quite a long time bordering on socialism in some cases like guaranteed income for all.  So where are they headed? Jonah Goldberg on that. And President Obama&aposs return to the spotlight ahead.  Plus, cleared of corruption and back on the campaign trail, but this time New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez may have some competition on his hands. His challenger is Republican Bob Hugin and he joins me next.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Bob Menendez chose a life in politics serving his donors, getting indicted. Bob Hugin chose a life of service. He&aposs the better Bob for Senate. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. BOB MENENDEZ, D-N.J.: To those who were digging my political grave so that they could jump into my seat, I know who you are and I won&apost forget you. (END VIDEO CLIP)  MACCALLUM: Remember that? So less than four months until the 2018 midterms, I think it&aposs about 100 days and the New Jersey Senate race is in a statistical dead heat according to a local poll and it&aposs starting to get some attention because there&aposs a real chance that the traditionally safe Democratic seat could possibly for the first time since 1972 possibly go red.  So you&aposve got two-term Senator Bob Menendez who was cleared this year of corruption charges. It was basically the jury in both cases, both trials did not reach a decision, they deadlocked. It&aposs a tight race with Bob Hugin, a former drug company executive and CEO of Celgene. So Bob is here live in just a moment. But first, Chris Stirewalt, Fox News politics editor for more on this race. So this could potentially get interesting, Chris, which, you know, it doesn&apost usually happen in New Jersey.  CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: Well, New Jersey politics are interesting.  MACCALLUM: That&aposs for sure.  STIREWALT: Yes. But usually not in good ways. Look, here&aposs the thing, it&aposs a tough year for Republicans in New Jersey and in a lot of places and a lot of blue states and let&aposs be honest from the start, this is a long shot. This is a hard one. MACCALLUM: Yes. STIREWALT: But you have in Mr. Hugin what Republicans love to see. They have this year a lot of places where they are spending money to try to gain seats in the Senate. This is one where you have a person who has money of his own and has a donor base that he can call on to help them out and he can become instantly viable essentially in this race.  Menendez is badly damaged. He was not really cleared-cleared in the sense that prosecutors eventually said look, we are dropping what we&aposre doing. They didn&apost say we think he&aposs just peachy keen. What they said was we can&apost get there from here and we give up. And that&aposs going to hang over him.  And also resentment inside his party toward him for the way he did this. It would have been much better for him for Democrats to have stepped aside and let somebody without the baggage run. He&aposs forcing it and now there is some division there.  MACCALLUM: Yes. Indeed, there is. So what&aposs the vulnerability for Bob Hugin?  STIREWALT: He is a Republican, it is New Jersey. The brand in New Jersey right now for Republican is bad so he has to be a different kind of Republican to fit in, in New Jersey, but it has worked in the past. Chris Christie, et cetera. So things are possible and we are definitely watching this race in a way that we normally wouldn&apost.  (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: We are watching this race. Thank you, my friend. Good to see you tonight.  STIREWALT: You bet. MACCALLUM: Thanks for being here, Chris. So we invited incumbent Democratic Senator Bob Menendez to join us tonight. He had a prior engagement and that invitation is open.  Joining me now is Bob Hugin, Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in New Jersey and former CEO of Celgene Pharmaceuticals. Good to see you, Bob. Good to have you here tonight. Let&aposs take a look at -- we looked in the tease at your ad against Bob Menendez. But let&aposs look at what he is running against you.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When the cause is just, we don&apost give in. When the odds are long, we don&apost give up.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Bob has always made us proud. Always.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We cannot let the dark cloud cast by the president define us as a country. (END VIDEO CLIP)  MACCALLUM: It doesn&apost mention you a whole lot in there. But what do you make of the race you are up against?  BOB HUGIN, R-SENATE CANDIDATE, NEW JERSEY: Well, first of all, I think long shot is the wrong characterization. The two most recent polls are within the margin of error. It&aposs a dead heat right now. The people of New Jersey are realizing they have a real choice this year.  MACCALLUM: You are a former marine. You were the first to go to college in your family. And you know, I think a lot of people look at you and say, you know, he&aposs a wealthy man, very successful. You put $15 million of your own money-- HUGIN: Yes. MACDONALD: -- into this race. And so I can imagine in a debate environment, because I moderate a lot of debates, that that&aposs how he&aposs going to go at you that you are the rich guy and you are funding your own campaign, kind of like Donald Trump.  HUGIN: Yes. Listen, as you said, I lived the American dream. I was born in Jersey City, raised in Union City. First of my family to go to college. Serve the Marine Corps, served my country. I went to a struggling company, six weeks of cash left and now one of the leading companies in the world fighting cancer. So we&aposre going to make a difference here. And the other thing is, let&aposs be clear. In Washington you never see bipartisanship. Senate ethics committee, Democrats and Republicans, Senator Menendez violated the law, abused the power of his office, disgraced the Senate, it&aposs time for change. It fails. MACCALLUM: All right. So how do you convince Democratic voters in New Jersey, because there are more of them than there are Republicans, that they should take a chance on you, and will you ask President Trump to campaign with you?  HUGIN: Well, first of all, the people of New Jersey are speaking. I go to all over. They realize that not only has he morally offended them and embarrass them, he&aposs been in Washington for 25 years, 16 years with a Democratic president in New Jersey is dead last.  We get the least back from any state in the country of the percentage of what we send and it&aposs headed in the wrong direction. Its failed leadership. We are going to put New Jersey first.  MACCALLUM: So you didn&apost answer my question. Do you want Trump to campaign with you?  HUGIN: Listen, this race is Bob Menendez against Bob Hugin. I want everybody to come and support me as long as it&aposs about New Jersey issues and the issues that we are fighting for, for all the people of New Jersey.  MACCALLUM: And what about Chris Christie, would you like him to campaign with you?  HUGIN: Again, I want anybody who believes in the values that I have from New Jersey. I&aposm listening to New Jerseyans. It&aposs clear what they want. They want a more affordable state. We need to be supported better in Trenton and in Washington. And it&aposs about Menendez versus Hugin.  MACCALLUM: I live in New Jersey, which, you know, I think maybe our viewers are aware of. You&aposve got a lot of people who want to leave the state. They are getting taxed out of the state. A lot of businesses. So I would imagine that that&aposs one of the areas that you are going to want to drive home.  HUGIN: Yes. Listen, it&aposs a shame. You want to be able to have your children -- I&aposm lucky, I have three kids. We raised our kids in New Jersey. My daughter works at Giovanni Yogurt here in New York. Both my sons are officers in the Marine Corps.  I want them to be able to come back to New Jersey but it&aposs so unaffordable now people are planning their exit. We got to change. We&aposve got to see the light at the end of the tunnel and say we are going to have Trenton and Washington focus on making New Jersey affordable again.  MACCALLUM: Bob, thank you very much. We&aposll be watching. Interesting to meet you. Thanks for being here tonight. (CROSSTALK) HUGIN: Great to be with you. Thank you. MACCALLUM: You bet. So coming up next.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT: I&aposm not being alarmist, I am simply stating the facts. Look around.  (APPLAUSE) OBAMA: Strongman politics are assented.  (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: So is that true? Are those the facts? Jonah Goldberg is up next and says the rebirth of populism and nationalism is destroying American democracy. He&aposs always so cheery and he joins me next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OBAMA: Look around.  (APPLAUSE) OBAMA: Strongman politics are ascendant suddenly. Whereby elections in some pretense of democracy are maintained, the form of it, but those in power seek to undermine every institution or norm that gives democracy meaning. (END VIDEO CLIP)  MACCALLUM: That was President Obama stepping back into the spotlight this week and taking some shots, without saying his name, at President Trump, suggesting that strongman politics, as you heard him say they are, are on the rise and perhaps some of our Democratic freedoms are at stake.  Joining me now, Jonah Goldberg, Fox News contributor and author of the new book ""Suicide of the West."" Who better to talk to about democracy and the future of America? Hi, Jonah. Good to see you tonight.  JONAH GOLDBERG, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Hi, Martha. MACCALLUM: So what about this argument that strongman are ascendant?  GOLDBERG: Well, look, I think you&aposre probably right that Barack Obama was, as the kids say, sub tweeting Donald Trump a little bit. You know, he didn&apost use his name but that people were supposed to take away that association.  But it is worth pointing out that strongman politics is ascendant in large parts of the globe. There are lots of countries that are looking at the Putin Model, the Chinese model. Viktor Orban in Hungary has talked about how liberal Democratic capitalism may be has run its course.  In Mexico they just elected a big populist demagogue guy. We look at what happened in Venezuela, which should be a cautionary tale.  The rhetoric about how democracy and liberal democratic capitalism is fading in a lot, in many parts of the world these days and I do think that you can make the argument that some of that is happening in the United States too.  I don&apost think that Donald Trump is a strongman. I do think he likes a lot of strong men, or says nice things about them, but that&aposs a little different thing than saying that Donald Trump is a strongman.  MACCALLUM: We had (Inaudible) Steven Pinker a while ago. I mean, he talked about the rise of democracy, actually, and how the situation for most people has become better in the world in recent decades. He said now you&aposve got -- he said, you know, when he was a kid you had about 60 democracies in the world. Now you have 100 and that this notion that the world is becoming a less great place to live is just simply not true when you look at the economies around the globe.  Democracy is going around the globe. The decline in disease around the globe. That it actually is a much more optimistic picture than President Obama wants to paint.  GOLDBERG: No. Look, I agree with that and you know, Steven Pinker makes a very similar argument to one of the ones that I make in my book. That, you know, in terms of human prosperity, this is the greatest moment to be alive in all of human history.  We actually, right now in this moment are living in the greatest moment of poverty alleviation in the history of humanity. But at the same time, we don&apost teach people to be grateful for this. We don&apost teach people to be thankful for this.  Instead, we get on the left and on certain parts of the right, the opposite of gratitude, which is resentment and entitlement.  MACCALLUM: Well-- GOLDBERG: And as Ronald Reagan -- as Ronald Reagan said, you know, tyranny is never more than one generation away because we don&apost inherit it in our blood, it&aposs got to be fought for and taught in every generation and we&aposre not doing a great job of that.  MACCALLUM: Well, you know, I thought it was interesting when the president -- when President Obama was talking about strongman, you know, and I think about another way of looking at that is that a strongman, you know, some might make the argument, conservatives might make the argument, that the strongman is the government and that the government has grown and grown and grown and encroached on people&aposs freedoms.  We have encouraged more people to go into food stamps. We&aposve expanded -- you know, now we are talking about guaranteed income in Chicago so that -- maybe it&aposs not embodied in one human being, but that the government is a fearful strongman for many people.  GOLDBERG: I agree with that entirely. And I think that this is one of the ironies is when you hear from so many people on the sort of the Democratic left in America, they are constantly saying Donald Trump is a strongman, we don&apost need strongman.  What we need is socialism, which is basically giving millions of bureaucrat&aposs strongman powers over their lives. And I do think that one of the best arguments for Donald Trump&aposs election was this idea that the government establishment, the globalist, whatever you want to call it, were having too much power over our lives and we needed someone to come in and smash all of that up. And to the extent the things that Donald Trump is doing to smash a lot of that stuff up I support a great deal.  MACCALLUM: Yes. I mean, also when you look at the rise of Kim Jong-un, when you look at what happened with China over the course of the Obama years, the expansion into the South China Seas, the huge expansion of -- their, you know, trade -- their robbing of our intellectual property all of that.  You look at Putin moving into Crimea, into Ukraine. All of that happened on President Obama&aposs watch. So it&aposs difficult to argue that the strongman has become more active since he left.  GOLDBERG: No. I think -- I think one of the reasons why though, that a lot of those things happen was in part because Barack Obama had a theory about how the world works that was in direct defiance of how the world actually works, and so he showed weakness to strongman around the world and strongman did what strongman do.  MACCALLUM: You are a strongman, but in a different way. Jonah, good to see you tonight. Thank you very much.  GOLDBERG: Thank you. MACCALLUM: Thanks for being here.  GOLDBERG: Good to be here. MACCALLUM: So still ahead tonight, a sneak peek about what the new Air Force One could look like, and we have a huge debate over whether or not it should be changed. Stick around, we&aposll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: So President Trump says that Air Force One needs a makeover, the iconic baby blue to be ramped up with a more patriotic red, white, and blue which the president says would be more American. The changes are scheduled to take effect in 2024.  Here is one person&aposs interpretation of what it could potentially look like. According to Axios, ""I don&apost like this particular version it looks like a hockey helmet to me. You know how goalies paint their helmets. That&aposs what it looks like.""  So here&aposs what they said on Twitter. Russ Bourne says this. ""I think it should have been red, white, and blue to begin with.""  Eric Snyder disagrees. He says it must be left as it is. The original iconic colors the plane stands for freedom and that symbol is highly recognizable around the world.  So here&aposs tonight&aposs quote from President George W. Bush on the last flight for Air Force One tail number 27,000 question.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEORGE W. BUSH, FORMER PRESIDENT: This plane tail number 27,000 bore the name of Air Force One for 444 missions and more than one million miles. Today it carried a president for the last time. And soon it will be taking its last flight. It will carry no more presidents but it will carry forever the spirit of American democracy.  (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: I think they should leave it the way it is but I don&apost think the president will listen to me or probably any of the Twitter folks.  That is our story for tonight. Thanks for being with us, everybody. Tucker Carlson is coming up next live from Washington, D.C. Have a good night, everybody.   Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

10,2018-06-23 00:00:00,2018,6.0,23,Fox News,Alec Baldwin says GOP Rep. Peter King has 'got to go',"
          Hollywood A-lister Alec Baldwin called out the Republican House member while at a fundraiser for Democratic House of Representatives candidate Liuba Grechen Shirley.
           (Reuters) Actor Alec Baldwin has called out GOP Rep. Peter King by comparing the New York Republican congressional candidate to a crossing guard. While in attendance at a Bridgehampton, New York, fundraiser for Democratic candidate Liuba Grechen Shirley, the ""30 Rock"" alum showed off his support for Shirley by taking aim at King. “He will do anything to hold onto power. The guy probably couldn’t get a job,” Baldwin said at the Friday night event according to  Page Six . “This job is a job that completes him as a human being. If he was in the private sector, he’d probably be a crossing guard or something I don’t really know."" He then added, “No offense to crossing guards, by the way."" The actor also went on to say that the GOP representative wouldn’t have “as much attention, and as much glory and as much ego stroking if he weren’t on the government dime.” According to Page Six, while the actor ranted about Shirley&aposs opponent, the Democratic candidate appeared ""nervous"" during the 60-year-old&aposs speech but managed to crack a smile after Baldwin offered ""no offense"" to crossing guards. “He’s a guy that’s held onto this job, gaming the current system, getting re-elected. Incumbency is a very, very powerful,” Baldwin said of King who has been a member of the House of Representatives since 2013. “His time is up. He’s got to go. He’s got to go.""",https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/alec-baldwin-says-gop-rep-peter-king-has-got-to-go,Celebrity News,Fox News
11,2018-07-11 00:00:00,2018,7.0,11,David Bossie,"At the NATO summit, Trump is standing up for fair treatment for America","close Video President Trump arrives in Brussels ahead of NATO Summit The president prepares to meet with European leaders after being very critical of NATO in the days leading to the summit. Greg Palkot reports.  President Trump  is in Europe,  attending a two-day NATO summit in Belgium as part of a trip that will include meetings with British Prime Minister Theresa May and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The American political establishment has learned over the past 18 months that with President Trump in office, business as usual is over. The international political establishment is now finding this out as well. Countries in the European Union and Asia in particular are coming to grips with the fact that President Trump is fighting for fair trade and security for our citizens – putting “America First.” The United States has spent the seven decades in the post-World War II era going above and beyond the call of duty in providing security and financial aid around the world. Since 1949, our steadfast allies in NATO have gotten used to America doing more and more for everyone, while expecting little in return. Over the course of the past 20 years or so, the American people have grown weary of their government prioritizing seemingly everything but the hardworking American taxpayer. These are the forgotten men and women who wake up early every day, go to work, pay their taxes on time, and take care of their families. Fighting for these folks is a big part of the “Make America Great Again” Trump doctrine. Throughout history, leaders of entrenched power structures have not reacted well to change. But President Trump has courage to take them on when necessary. President Trump is not interested in continuing the failed status quo that’s been perpetuated by presidents of both parties for decades. On issue after issue, if he sees a policy that he believes is not in America’s best interests, this president is asking the tough questions that career politicians never do. To tens of millions of American voters it’s just common sense; and it’s precisely the outside-the-box thinking that propelled the change agent Donald Trump to the presidency in the first place. With attention focused on President Trump’s outstanding choice in nominating Judge Brett Kavanaugh to succeed retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy as the next associate justice on the Supreme Court – and on the heels of the our trade disputes with other nations– the president is in Brussels to advocate for America once again at the NATO summit. President Trump prides himself on taking a fresh look at how American taxpayer dollars are spent at home and abroad. That means he is not a typical politician in the mold that organizations like NATO have grown used to. The businessman and master negotiator in the president has him taking reform-minded stances on behalf of the American people. Throughout history, leaders of entrenched power structures have not reacted well to change. But President Trump has courage to take them on when necessary. The president asks simple straightforward questions like: Why does the United States pay so much to support NATO’s mission compared to every other NATO member? Similarly to renegotiating some of our unfavorable trade deals, President Trump knows nothing will change unless he educates the American people and the world that the United States can ask to be treated fairly in international relationships and agreements – just like everyone else. NATO member nations have committed to try and spend 2 percent of their gross domestic products on national defense. President Trump wants to know why only five countries have reached that goal, when the United States is leading the way with over 3.5 percent of U.S. GDP spent on defense – a much larger share of GDP than every other country.  For example, why is an economic powerhouse like Germany only spending 1.24 percent of its GDP on defense?  Would it be too much to make the 2 percent threshold a requirement instead of a suggestion?  After all, there is nothing more important to citizens than their national security. If President Trump thinks the United States is being taken advantage of, he’s not going stand idly by and let it happen. The bottom line is that if all 29 countries in NATO made good on their 2 percent commitment, the U.S. taxpayer would be paying less. President Trump takes seriously our security commitments. However, we need our allies to step up and do the same. It’s only fair.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/at-the-nato-summit-trump-is-standing-up-for-fair-treatment-for-america,OPINION,Fox News
12,2018-06-07 00:00:00,2018,6.0,7,Stephen Sorace,Samantha Bee 'sorry' in first 'Full Frontal' since calling Ivanka Trump c-word,"close Video Samantha Bee apologizes for calling Ivanka Trump the c-word Host of the TBS show 'Full Frontal' addresses the firestorm over the vulgar comment she made about President Trump's daughter; reaction from Fox News media analyst Howard Kurtz, host of 'MediaBuzz.' Samantha Bee opened Wednesday night’s episode of her TBS show, “Full Frontal,” by addressing the firestorm that erupted after last week’s show, in which she referred to Ivanka Trump as ""a feckless c---"" during a segment on immigration policy. It was the late-night comedian’s first show since drawing the ire of advertisers, viewers and President Donald Trump -- and she told viewers that her insult directed at the first daughter “crossed a line.” ""It is a word I have used on the show many times, hoping to reclaim it,” Bee said. “This time, I used it as an insult. I crossed a line. I regret it and I do apologize."" The former member of comedian Jon Stewart&aposs ""Daily Show"" troupe on Comedy Central acknowledged that some women “don’t want that word reclaimed” and she didn’t want “to inflict more pain on them.” But Bee, 48, mixed in some humor with her apology, saying that while her goal was to produce a “challenging” and “honest” show, “I never intended it to hurt anyone — except Ted Cruz.” Bee also joked that, “Many men were also offended by my use of the word — I do not care about that.” Video Last week’s profane insult sparked outrage from many, leading sponsors like AutoTrader and State Farm to pull their ads from the show. Both Bee and TBS issued apologies the following day, with  the network tweeting  the “vile” comment was “our mistake too, and we regret it.” Bee’s words also fired up  accusations of a politically based double standard , with critics comparing TBS’s “non-reaction” to the Bee controversy with ABC’s firing of Roseanne Barr from her namesake sitcom over a racist tweet. Barr is well known as a Trump supporter, while Bee, a liberal, has been critical of the administration. The same day as her apology, Bee received a “social change” honor from the Television Academy.  The press was blocked from attending the event’s reception  and Bee avoided the red carpet interviews before the event amid the surrounding controversy. Video In her reception speech that night, Bee again apologized, acknowledging the “one bad word” she used distracted from the immigration issues she intended to shed light on. “We spent the day wrestling with the repercussions of one bad word, when we all should have spent the day incensed that as a nation we are wrenching children from their parents and treating people legally seeking asylum as criminals,” Bee said in her speech, obtained by  IndieWire . The host hit on this issue again in Wednesday’s monologue, ultimately conceding her words “distracted” viewers from the children affected by the administration’s juvenile immigration policy. Bee apologized to the kids, too. Video Bee concluded Wednesday night&aposs third apology by giving those who worried about “the death of civility” this past week something to think about. ""I&aposm really sorry that I said that word, but you know what? Civility is just nice words,"" she said. ""Maybe we should all worry a little bit more about the niceness of our actions."" Even after Bee’s many apologies, TBS -- part of the Turner Broadcasting System conglomerate that includes CNN, TNT and other stations -- will reportedly step up its oversight of the late-night show to prevent further incidents that could scare away advertisers and draw public condemnation, a source close to the matter told  the Hollywood Reporter  Wednesday.",https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/samantha-bee-sorry-in-first-full-frontal-since-calling-ivanka-trump-c-word,Scandal,Fox News
13,2018-06-21 00:00:00,2018,6.0,21,Associated Press,Syria shells rebel-held areas ahead of possible offensive,"BEIRUT –  Syrian government forces shelled rebel-held areas in the south on Thursday, further undermining an international ""de-escalation"" agreement backed by the United States ahead of a threatened offensive, prompting a warning from the U.S. of ""serious repercussions"" for the violations. The U.S., Russia and Jordan negotiated a truce for the area, which borders Jordan and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, in July of last year. But the calm has started to unravel in recent weeks, and a war monitoring group said more than 12,500 people have been displaced since Tuesday, with most moving into other rebel-held areas. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported the shelling Thursday in areas northeast of the city of Daraa. The rebel factions hold parts of the city and areas to its west and east. The rebels also control areas along the borders with Jordan and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. State media said the government is shelling ""terrorists&apos"" posts northeast of Daraa, destroying their weapons. The United States warned Russia and Syria&aposs President Bashar Assad of ""serious repercussions."" State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement the U.S. remains ""deeply troubled"" by reports of ""increasing Syrian regime operations"" within the boundaries of the truce and demanded that Russia ""restrain"" Assad&aposs forces from further action in the zone covered by the truce. She said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo relayed that message to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov by phone over the weekend. The statement, however, omitted a line in a past statement on the subject that said the U.S. would take ""firm and appropriate measures"" if Syria violated the de-escalation measure. A spokesman said Thursday the U.N. is ""deeply concerned"" about the safety of 750,000 people in the region and called on all the parties involved to protect civilians. The government has turned its attention to the south after capturing the last rebel-held areas around the capital, Damascus, earlier this year. Israel has meanwhile carried out strikes against Syrian and Iranian forces in the area in recent months, after repeatedly warning against any Iranian buildup near the border. Iran is a close ally of Assad, and its advisers are embedded with his troops. Iranian-backed militias are also believed to be deployed in the area. Government planes have dropped leaflets this week over rebel-held parts of Daraa province, comparing the area to the Damascus suburbs of eastern Ghouta and urging its residents to ""cooperate"" with the armed forces to drive out armed groups. The government besieged eastern Ghouta before waging a crushing military offensive. Government troops are meanwhile massing, mostly in the nearby Sweida province. Rebel groups have responded by establishing a joint operations command to coordinate their defense of what the opposition refers to as the ""death triangle."" Assad told Iranian TV last week that talks between the Russians, the Americans and the Israelis are still ""ongoing,"" but said the Iranian presence in the area was not negotiable. Israel is believed to be seeking an agreement in which Iran and its allied militias would withdraw from the border area. The Syrian observatory later reported that a deal was reached, based on Russia&aposs mediation, in which Iranian advisers and Iranian backed militia would withdraw, leaving a buffer of 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the occupied Golan Heights and the Jordanian border. The withdrawal, if confirmed, would be in line with negotiations led by Moscow. In Syria, an official with the so-called axis of resistance led by Iran and including Syria and Hezbollah, denied a deal had been reached. ___ Associated Press writers Bassem Mroue in Beirut, Josh Lederman in Washington and Jennifer Peltz at the United Nations contributed reporting.",https://www.foxnews.com/world/syria-shells-rebel-held-areas-ahead-of-possible-offensive,World,Fox News

          In a letter obtained by Fox News, Senator Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., formally asked Inspector General Michael Horowitz to resolve conflicting statements about a meeting discussed in text messages between Strzok and his colleague and lover Lisa Page.
           Sen. Lindsey Graham is calling on the Justice Department to set the record straight about an alleged meeting involving then-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, agent Peter Strzok and attorney Lisa Page, in which “an insurance policy” against a possible Trump victory in the 2016 election purportedly was discussed. In a letter obtained by Fox News, Graham, R-S.C., formally asked Inspector General Michael Horowitz to resolve conflicting statements about a meeting discussed in text messages between Strzok and Page, his colleague and lover.   2018-6-20 Letter to IG Horowitz Re Insurance Policy  by  Fox News  on Scribd 
 In a text from Strzok to Page dated Aug. 15, 2016, the pair discussed “an insurance policy” in the event that Donald Trump went on to win the presidential election. “I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy’s office – that there’s no way he gets elected – but I’m afraid we can’t take the risk. It’s like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you’re 40,” the text read. FBI AGENT PETER STRZOK ‘ESCORTED’ FROM FBI BUILDING, LAWYER CONFIRMS Horowitz confirmed in his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday that “Andy” referred to McCabe. “Based on your answers, I have the impression Strzok told your office that McCabe, in fact, attended the meeting referenced in the text message,” Graham wrote in his letter. “It is further my understanding that McCabe told your office he denied attending, or did not recall,"" the meeting that was referenced in the text. If it is true that McCabe was present for such a discussion, it would “show bias and inappropriate behavior at the highest levels of the FBI,” Graham said. MCCABE ASKS FOR IMMUNITY AHEAD OF CONGRESSIONAL HEARING ON HANDLING OF CLINTON CASE “I believe it would be of grave consequence if the deputy director of the FBI met with the lead investigator of the Clinton email and Russia investigations to talk about ‘an insurance policy’ against Donald Trump’s victory in the 2016 election.” It was unclear whether Horowitz would respond, but the Republican senator asked for all documents, statements and transcripts that related to the text message in order to determine who was at the meeting in question.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/sen-lindsey-graham-asks-horowitz-if-strzok-or-mccabe-misled-investigators,POLITICS,Fox News
15,2018-06-24 00:00:00,2018,6.0,24,Dan Gainor,Immigration policy gives Trump-hating media a new reason to go overboard demonizing him and his team,"close Video Trump's immigration crackdown sparks debate Immigration is an issue that has people from both sides of the aisle heated; talk radio hosts weigh in on 'America's News HQ.' Media criticism of President Trump’s immigration policy reached a fever pitch this past week, as the president was demonized and called every name in the book, while some members of his administration and family were threatened and harassed. In theory, it was all part of the immigration fight. In practice, it was one more opportunity for Trump-haters to launch extreme attacks against the president and those close to him. The left hounded administration officials at  restaurants  and at  home , which thrilled Univision anchor  Jorge Ramos.  Protestors confronted Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen while she was eating at a restaurant and at her home, while White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders was  kicked out of a restaurant  because she works for President Trump.   Far-left  Splinter News tweeted out  the personal cell phone number of White House senior adviser Stephen Miller, and a fading Hollywood star called for the president’s youngest son to be dragged from his mother and “put in a cage with pedophiles.” That barely begins the hate-fest. Canadian comedy writer  Pat Dussault  apologized after tweeting what appeared to be a disturbing threat to Donald Trump Jr.’s 4-year-old daughter. “Don’t worry, we’re coming for Chloe, too,” he wrote. Next, there was the widespread assault on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Former “Sex and the City” star Cynthia Nixon – now seeking the Democratic nomination for governor of New York against Gov. Andrew Cuomo – called the officers a  “terrorist organization.” The anti-American “journalism” group Wikileaks posted a database of ICE officers. Open borders extremist and Border Angels Founder Enrique Morones told “The Beat With Ari Melber” on MSNBC: “Donald Trump, without a doubt, is pure evil.” Then for the coup de grâce, New Yorker magazine staff writer and fact checker Talia Lavin tried to ruin the career of an ICE employee over a  tattoo . She tweeted that she thought the elbow tattoo of wounded Marine veteran Justin Gaertner was a Nazi Iron Cross. Turns out, it was the symbol of his unit in Afghanistan, where this hero also lost both his legs. Lavin resigned and apologized, but still found the gall to complain about ICE, which had complained about her. “I do not think it is acceptable for a federal agency to target a private citizen for a good faith, hastily rectified error,” she  tweeted . The media piled on all week. “Morning Joe” Co-host Mika Brzezinski declared: “If you vote for Trump, then you, the voter, you, not Donald Trump, are standing at the border, like Nazis.” That’s not too different from what  Rolling Stone  writer Ana Marie Cox thought about a rally President Trump spoke to in Minnesota. She described it as “the way the end of democracy sounds.” And in one last sign of the journalism  apocalypse , Politico even dredged up one of Stephen Miller’s third-grade classmates to write an immigration article that was a ridiculous attempt at journalism, headlined  ""I Sat on the Other Side of Stephen Miller&aposs First Wall."" But remember, there’s no media bias. None. Whatsoever. 2. This Is Fake News:  CNN’s Senior Media Correspondent Brian Stelter said in January that President Trump averaged calling something  “fake” at least once a day . There might be a good reason for that – the news media. This past week, journalists delivered on two major examples of fake news. Both were so astonishingly egregious that it’s a wonder how many journalists stay employed. It’s almost as if facts don’t matter. Time magazine continued to fill recycling bins with anti-Trump material. At least  10 of its 23 covers  this year have targeted his administration. Five have depicted the president personally – from having his hair on fire to appearing as king. The latest cover showed the president looming over a crying immigrant child. The headline read:  “Welcome to America.”  The media went bonkers, with TV outlets pitching it as news. Only it wasn’t. Turns out the doctored image that merged Trump and the little girl as if they were standing together (they weren’t) was more than a little inaccurate. The girl was indeed separated from her mom – by about two feet. Of course, the media loved the phony image. ABC, CBS, NBC, MSNBC and CNN  all reported on it.  “CBS This Morning” Co-host John Dickerson summed up the approval, referring to it as “an iconic – a now-iconic photo taken last week captured that girl as her mother was detained.” Girl on TIME cover was not separated from mom, family says TIME Magazine's latest cover shows President Trump staring down the viral image of a little girl crying while her mother was being detained by Border Patrol. It gets worse. The girl’s mother has been  deported previously  for illegal immigration. Time’s correction of the whole affair was laughably  dishonest , admitting only that the “story misstated what happened to the girl in the photo.” To its credit,  CBS actually fact-checked  the image. Correspondent David Begnaud warned viewers about the bogus cover: “You may have seen the photo, you may have shared it on social media. A lot of people have. And with it, there’s been a lot of misinformation that’s been spread.” For more on that “misinformation,” check out Daily Caller Media and Breaking News  Editor Amber Athey’s piece. That was more elaborate than what happened to former Trump Campaign Chairman Paul Manafort. But the result was much the same. As President Trump spoke on immigration during an ABC News broadcast, a graphic at the bottom of the screen falsely  proclaimed : “Manafort Pleads Guilty to 5 Charges of Manslaughter.” No one has ever accused Manafort of manslaughter. The brain trust at error-prone ABC (admittedly, not brainy or trustworthy) was quick to release an apology. “There simply is no excuse for this sort of mistake,” it wrote saying network officials “are investigating” how it happened. At least, this time it wasn’t ABC News Chief Investigative Correspondent  Brian Ross  tanking the entire stock market. Washington Post Media Critic Eric Wemple crushed ABC in a story headlined:  “In colossal error, ABC News reports that Paul Manafort ‘pleads guilty’ to manslaughter.”  Wemple came up with three scenarios how it happened. The first two ended by calling it “a clear scandal with disciplinary implications.” The third version added “or perhaps law-enforcement implications.” Do ABC lawyers get combat pay?",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/immigration-policy-gives-trump-hating-media-a-new-reason-to-go-overboard-demonizing-him-and-his-team,OPINION,Fox News

Founded on Rikers island this gang is responsible for murders, robberies, and drugs.  A ‘Wall of Grief’ mural marks the spot where a 15-year-old Bronx boy, who wanted to be a detective when he grew up, fell victim last month to a New York City drug gang with a long history of ruthless violence. The mural pays tribute to Lesandro “Junior” Guzman-Feliz who was killed June 20 by a group of Trinitarios in a crime that sent shockwaves reverberating through the Big Apple and beyond. The murder captured the attention of music stars Rihanna and Cardi B. News outlets aired chilling surveillance video of the boy struggling for his life as he was dragged out of a bodega and slashed with a machete and knives.

       (AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews) Bronx prosecutors last week announced the indictment of 12 Trinitarios in the boy’s death and said Lesandro was killed after he was mistaken for a Trinitario from a rival “set” the group was plotting against. Police said Lesandro had no gang affiliation. Two days earlier, in another shocking display of violence, Trinitarios stabbed and beat a 14-year-old member of a rival gang as cars stopped on a busy Bronx six-lane highway. The boy was stabbed more than 13 times and had to be revived after going into cardiac arrest on the way to the hospital. Police released video of the attack and federal prosecutors arrested a Bronx man who admitted striking the boy with a log.

       (NYPD) The violence appears to mark a re-emergence of a gang that had fallen into the shadows after a series of law enforcement takedowns from 2009 to 2014 wiped out the group’s leader and a large number of members. But those prosecutors have appear to have created a power struggle pitting one group of Trinitarios against another. Just four years ago, federal prosecutors said the Trinitarios if they weren’t extinct, they were certainly an endangered species. But they appear to be back and this time thrust into a national spotlight. Such acts of brutality don’t surprise Manuel Gomez, a former U.S. army intelligence officer and NYPD cop-turned-private investigator, who said he obtained the video of Lesandro’s last moments and shared it with  WPIX-TV , which was the first to report it. BRONX TEEN DENIED HELP AS HE BLED TO DEATH INSIDE BODEGA, DISTURBING VIDEO SHOWS Gomez told Fox News that the Trinitarios have been just as vicious as MS-13 without drawing the same amount of attention. President Trump has singled out the former for its brutality - labeling them “animals” - as part of his crackdown on illegal immigration. “Trinitarios are just as blatant as MS-13 when it comes to killing someone and just walking away,” Gomez said. Trinitarios are Dominican; MS-13 is Salvadoran Gomez said the ranks of the Trinitarios include several individuals who are in the country illegally. He also said Trinitarios recruit new members in high schools. Some recruits are even younger. As part of the initiation process recruits are required to run a gauntlet. “Their preferred weapon of choice is the machete and the knife and their philosophy is ‘a gun runs out of bullets but a knife never does,’” Gomez said. MS-13 CRACKDOWN WINS PRAISE FOR TRUMP AHEAD OF NY GANG SUMMIT The Trinitarios were founded by Leonides Sierra while he was serving time in Rikers Island to protect Dominican inmates from other violent gang members. In 2014 he was sentenced to 19 years in federal prison for his role as the gang’s leader. He is still serving a state prison sentence for a 1989 murder. “When Sierra created the Trinitarios gang on Rikers Island in 1992, a dangerous and bloodthirsty organization was born, responsible for overwhelming violence both on the streets of New York and other cities, and inside the prison system,” then Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in announcing the sentence. The Trinitarios take as their own the Dominican Republic’s motto of “Dios, Patria y Libertad” — God, Fatherland and Liberty. The gang’s colors are blue, red and white –the colors of the Dominican flag—and green. Trinitarios exchange greetings with each other using hand sign. A Trinitario informant testified that would-be Trinitarios have to learn the rules and history of the gang and swear an oath before becoming members. Once a Trinitario is sworn in, there are documented rules and handbooks that all members are provided and are expected to follow, according to the informant. Members must also pay dues and attend mandatory meetings. WHAT IS MS-13, THE VIOLENT GANG TRUMP VOWED TO TARGET?

       (AP Photo/Seth Wenig) Trinitarios have feuded with other gangs, including the Bloods, the Latin Kings and Dominicans Don’t Play. The Trinitarios-DDP feud stretches back years. In 2016, a DDP member opened fire at a group of Trinitarios, striking and killing an innocent Bronx woman who was watching her three young children at play in a playground. In 2011, the FBI identified the Trinitarios as the largest Dominican gang in the country, followed by DDP. “The Trinitarios are involved in homicide, violent assaults, robbery, theft, home invasions, and street-level drug distribution,” the FBI said. “In addition to New York and New Jersey, the Trinitarios network included Georgia, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.” A 2011 NYPD database placed the number of Trinitarios in the city at nearly 1,200, according to  The New York Times . The database contained the names of nearly 24,000 gang members. From 2009 to 2012, federal prosecutors announced a series of racketeering indictments charging 149 Trinitarios and associates in connection with a variety of crimes, including nine murders and 24 attempted murders. The investigations began after a homicide in 2006 in Manhattan&aposs Washington Heights neighborhood. In 2010, Orlando Salgado was killed in the Bronx after a fight involving a Latin King and a Trinitario. Six Trinitarios chased down Salgado and attacked him with knives, a hammer and a pipe, according to court papers. In 2015, two of Salgado’s killers became government informants and testified that they participated in the murder because of the Trinitarios rule that “when a Trinatario bleeds, we all bleed.” More recently, according to the  New York Post , violence between rival Trinitarios has grown as the gang has splintered into several smaller factions, including the colorfully named Violating All Bit-hes, One Seven Hoes and the Bad Barbies. The Bad Barbies were dealt a major blow with the 2012 arrest of alleged leader Maria Mejia by the feds. She was charged in connection with a 2005 murder of DDP member. Gomez said the federal prosecutions led to a power struggle that pits “Los Sures” Trinitarios against another “Sunset” Trinitarios, rivals sets from Brooklyn encroaching on the Bronx. The night Lesandro was killed, his attackers gathered to plot attacks against ""Sunset"" Trinitarios, according to prosecutors. The gathering was held at the Bronx home of ""Los Sures"" Trinitario leader Diego Suero, they said. Those Trinitarios were travelling in four cars when they came upon Lesandro near the bodega in the Belmont section of the Bronx. Prosecutors said that the Lesandro&aposs killers then went back to Suero’s apartment to ditch their weapons. At the time of the murder Suero, 29, was out on bail after his in September on a gun charge, records show. Meanwhile, the latest spasm of Trinitario violence took place Saturday – but behind bars. More than a half-dozen Trinitarios smashed windows and toppled furniture at Rikers after learning a friend would be moved to another facility,  the New York Post reported .

18,2018-07-12 00:00:00,2018,7.0,12,Fox News,Sparks fly at fiery Strzok House hearing,"close Video Sparks fly at fiery Strzok House hearing Peter Strzok testifies on anti-Trump bias during explosive hearing on Capitol Hill; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" July 12, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST: Well, that was Peter Strzok, the FBI agent, lead investigator on the Clinton email probe, the lead investigator on the Trump-Russia probe. A lot of people are accusing him of bias and he denied bias all day long, grilled there on Capitol Hill for hours by a joint house committee. Let&aposs just take it around the table. That was a marathon today, Greg, very contentious.  GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: I felt like I was unemployed on the sofa watching eight -- back-to-back episodes of Jerry Springer. That was like parliament without the wigs. It&aposs either new low or a new high. I don&apost know what it is, but I call it a clown show, but clowns are sexier. This whole event reveals how little wisdom there is in this world. There&aposs so much noise, so little wisdom. Those are all smart people. They&aposre not dumb people. But the environment, the politics and the spotlight turns everybody into idiots. And I say all of them. I don&apost just say Strzok. By the way, Strzok, we&aposre never going to get to the truth because he has 30 lawyers there, 30 Democrats senators and con are there who are white knighting every time you want to get to the truth. They jumped in front of him to take the bullet. And it&aposs like, they&aposre not helping him. Nobody is helping him. His smirk drives me crazy. I just want to pull my hair out and scream and get wasted.  DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: I think you&aposve just describe how pretty much everyone watching feel. You have your finger on the pulse of America. GUTFELD: I have the finger on the pulse of something. WATTERS: Yeah. And for someone that has a nice smirk, his smirk definitely bother me as well. GUTFELD: You do. You&aposre smirk brothers.  WATTERS: Dana, I know you&aposve been glued to the TV all day.  PERINO: Absolutely.  WATTERS: Do you think the members of congress on the Republican side landed any solid blows today on Peter Strzok that kind of shed light on any of his activities with regard to the Trump-Russia investigation?  PERINO: Here&aposs what I know, I am sure if you ask the Republicans, did you land any blows on him, they will say absolutely yes and they&aposll give you lots of reasons. The Democrats would say absolutely not and they&aposll give you all of their reasons, and the polarization continues. I did think it was quite odd that you had the one congressman on the Democratic side said that he wanted to give Peter Strzok a Purple Heart, which is outrageous. That&aposs disgusting, actually. To suggest, given what the Purple Heart is actually for. Then, you had Democrats applauding part of the testimony that Peter Strzok gave, like that&aposs wholly inappropriate. And I thought there were several Republicans, including Louie Gohmert, I will say, went way overboard, it felt like a public lynching. I thought it was terrible.  GUTFELD: He should get a purple nerd ball. PERINO: You know what they should do with these hearings, and I know we&aposre on televisions so maybe we don&apost want to say this, they should not be on camera. They should be on the record. There could be reporters there. It wouldn&apost be in public. But as soon as you bring cameras into this situation you have all of this grand standing. WATTERS: Well, Watters&apos World may definitely take it live. GUTFELD: It turns it into a cable news show.  PERINO: Yeah. I mean, nothing against cable news.  WATTERS: Dana brought up a point about, you know, the Democrats consistently and constantly throughout the day attacked and interrupted and made a spectacle whenever a Republican was getting close to something, they would get out of order -- let&aposs just look at some of the contentious back- and-forth that happened during the hearing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNINDENTIFIED MALE: Point of order. The witness will answer the question. (CROSSTALK) UNINDENTIFIED MALE: Point of order, Mr. Chairman.  UNINDENTIFIED MALE: Attorney-client privilege. And he&aposs been advised not to answer the question. UNINDENTIFIED MALE: The gentlemen will suspend.  UNINDENTIFIED MALE: What rules are we following that would dictate such an answer by you, Mr. Chairman?  UNINDENTIFIED MALE: We are following the rules of the committee. UNINDENTIFIED MALE: Could site the rule? UNINDENTIFIED MALE: No.  (CROSSTALK) UNINDENTIFIED MALE: The Democratic members have a right to know what the rules are in governing this hearing.  UNINDENTIFIED MALE: Ladies and gentlemen. UNINDENTIFIED MALE: Can you share with us?  (CROSSTALK) UNINDENTIFIED MALE: Are you making up as you go along?  UNINDENTIFIED MALE: This is going to be tough for me to get through it. I keep getting interrupted. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Now, Juan Williams, you&aposve seen this for decades on Capitol Hill. Is there a strategy behind people interrupting and causing this type of chaos during a hearing in order to deflect? Or are these people just can&apost control themselves emotionally?  JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: I think the latter is true. I think this is grand standing. Someone just said that to me. This has been a day long grand standing. I like what Greg said about Jerry Springer. So it&aposs not cable news. It&aposs afternoon television, right? And it&aposs at its worst.  GUTFELD: But there&aposs no hair pulling because you have Louie Gohmert. WILLIAMS: No, no, no. What the guy -- the guy who would stand -- the big guy and he would prevent the fight. GUTFELD: Yeah, yeah, the bouncer. WILLIAMS: But they don&apost have that. They need that. But I will say, contrary to what you guys think, I thought Strzok explained some things. And don&apost forget, by the way, Dana, that you had Democrats who want to release the testimony that he gave earlier in closed-door hearing. And so far, the Republicans have said we don&apost want that released. I&aposm not clear exactly why?  PERINO: I don&apost know either. Like, at this point, just let it all out.  WILLIAMS: Yeah, let it go. But I do think that when Strzok said some things that, to me, were news. I mean, he said when he&aposs talking in what appeared to be, I think, to a Democrat or a Republican about, we&aposre going to stop Trump, and I thought that&aposs not good for an FBI agent to say. I understand therefore why Mueller and the FBI would let this guy go. He comes back and says he&aposs really upset about the way Trump had treated -- I think it&aposs Kamir Khan. GUTFELD: Gold Star family. WILLIAMS: The Gold Star family. And he&aposs saying he thought Americans, we as Americans wouldn&apost allow -- I mean, he could have talked about John McCain. PERINO: Stop, Juan. WILLIAMS: No, no, I&aposm just telling you what the man said. The second thing that struck me.  WATTERS: Can we before you get -- can we play some of that sound. We have what Juan was mentioning about the stop-Trump text. Let&aposs hear it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNINDENTIFIED MALE: I want to know what it meant, Agent Strzok.  STRZOK: It would be his candidacy for the president. (INAUDIBLE)  UNINDENTIFIED MALE: It&aposs not that tough.  STRZOK: My sense that the American population would not vote him into office.  UNINDENTIFIED MALE: Right, right. Well, we haven&apost gotten to the will yet. STRZOK: Well, I&aposm trying to. (CROSSTALK) STRZOK: . explain the text. UNINDENTIFIED MALE: The will of the American people, is that right? That&aposs your testimony. The, we&aposll stop it, you were speaking on behalf of the American people, is that correct?  STRZOK: Mr. Gowdy, what my testimony is and what I said during extensive asking of this question during my prior interview is I don&apost recall writing that text. What I can tell you is that text, in no way, suggested that I or the FBI would take any action to influence the candidates.  UNINDENTIFIED MALE: Agent Strzok, that is a fantastic answer to a question nobody asked. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Do you believe that? I don&apost remember that.  JEDEDIAH BILA, GUEST CO-HOST: No. First of all, you, obviously, remember it. And secondly, we&aposll stop it, means that there&aposs intent to do something to stop it. That&aposs not just him having an opinion. That&aposs not just him having a bias, which he obviously had. Which, by the way, Trey Gowdy did an excellent job of laying out, he laid out the history of bias of all the comments of this guy made about, not only President Trump but Trump voters, about how he was all, you know, glorifying Hillary Clinton and saying that she should win the election before he even interviewed her. So, there&aposs a whole history of bias. Then you have this text. It&aposs outrageous. I mean, this is what people say when they say that people in politics think that the American people are a bunch of morons in order to buy this, because there&aposs no way that you could believe -- not only that, Trey Gowdy also lays out in another point that he was thinking that Trump may, in fact, be able to win the election or -- it&aposs just ridiculous, honestly.  WILLIAMS: Here&aposs the second thing I wanted to say about Strzok. Strzok makes the case that if he really was trying to stop Donald Trump, he would have leaked the fact of the investigation into Russian collusion with the Trump campaign.  WATTERS: So here&aposs where I disagree with that, because I don&apost think they would ever leak that they were investigating Trump without any evidence because, remember, at that point, there was no evidence of collusion. We still have not seen any evidence of collusion, and Trump was running on a, the system is rigged against me, OK? And I don&apost think Obama would ever allow or whether like anybody leaking they&aposre investigating Donald Trump. Remember that was his answer for why we didn&apost do anything about Russia, and why we didn&apost do anything -- no, during the 2016 -- during 2016, in the fall, President Obama is on record as saying he didn&apost want to say anything because he didn&apost want to look like we were rigging the election against one candidate.  WILLIAMS: Jesse, you&aposre right, but that&aposs not what we&aposre talking about. We&aposre talking about this guy, this FBI agent, this former army ranger, this veteran. WATTERS: OK. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: Let me tell you, I&aposm a journalist. I know who leaks. Guys like him leak, and he didn&apost leak it.  WATTERS: OK. It was already out, Juan. The dossier was out. Harry Reid had been briefed on it by Brennan. To say this wasn&apost out there, it was out there.  GUTFELD: Can I add just something -- I find it interesting when you can&apost recall a text, but you can explain the context of a text that you don&apost recall sending. So, I don&apost remember doing it, but I remember what I meant. However, the thing is, he wins this argument because with a text exchange, it&aposs open to interpretation. I believe there&aposs something nefarious when he said we&aposll stop it. He was talking about him, the insider. But, it doesn&apost matter what I think because there are competing alternatives.  WATTERS: And it&aposs hard to prove. GUTFELD: And it&aposs hard to prove.  WATTERS: Because he can&apost answer any questions. Every time they ask him, when did you learned about the dossier was founded by Hillary, the FBI says I can&apost say anything. Where did you get the dossier from? The FBI says I can&apost say anything. So, I don&apost know if we&aposre actually getting anywhere where he can prove that his bias didn&apost affect his decision.  WILLIAMS: What is this? (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: Some kind of star-chamber proceedings. Oh, this is what we&aposre really after here, the heart and soul of this is, Agent Strzok, were you biased against Donald Trump during this campaign, and did you conduct your investigation in such a way as to hamper the Trump campaign and potentially aid the Clinton campaign? Well, he answered that.  WATTERS: We have sounds of it, and then I&aposm going to have Dana react. Let&aposs listen to what he said about whether bias affected his decision- making. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STRZOK: Let me be clear, unequivocally and under oath, not once in my 26 years of defending our nation did my personal opinions impact any official action I took. The fact is, after months of investigation, there&aposs simply no evidence of bias in my professional actions. This investigation is not politically motivated. It is not a witch hunt. It is not a hoax. It&aposs an impossible definition to say people must not have political opinions. Everyone does. Of course they do. The test is whether or not that is left behind when you&aposre doing your job. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: OK. Here&aposs an analogy, Dana. This looks like a left-wing journalist who&aposs been writing anti-Trump hit pieces for decades and has been investigating Trump, and it&aposs very, very viciously anti-Trump. And then when you ask him, you know, has your bias ever affected your writing and your journalism? No. I keep my personal opinions totally separate. Isn&apost that the same thing?  PERINO: Well, I think journalist do try to do that.  WATTERS: Oh, they try. PERINO: I would put myself in that category. So, yesterday, for example, I interviewed Brian Fallon from Demand Justice. He had been the press secretary for Hillary Clinton. Everyone knows that I was the press secretary to President Bush. Can, I, at 2 0&aposclock and during that show set aside my personal experiences or leanings as I interview him? I can say I could try, but it probably comes through. And so, I think there are -- this varies by degrees.  WATTERS: Right. PERINO: I think a better example might be a doctor, right? (CROSSTALK) (LAUGHTER) PERINO: You know what I mean about the doctor, like -- let&aposs say that there&aposs an anti-Trump doctor and somebody on the Trump team is having a heart attack, does the doctor walk away and say he doesn&apost see it, or does he take care of it?  WATTERS: The doctor resuscitate Hillary, and then he pulls the plug on Trump. That&aposs when you know the bias. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: Humor that speaks to your point. Ronald Reagan was shot, taken to the hospital, and Ronald Reagan looks up of the doctor as they&aposre about to operate and he says I hope some of you guys are Republican. That&aposs pretty good.  GUTFELD: You know why he said that because they would be better doctors. (LAUGHTER) GUTFELD: Thank you, America. WILLIAMS: Yeah, because they&aposll rip your heart out. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: We should step back. We look at the Mueller investigation. We look at these -- the collusion emails, Hillary re-litigating the election. We have all these confrontations. We have politicians and celebrities, you know, attacking Trump. At some point, we&aposre going to have to get over 2016.  PERINO: Yes. GUTFELD: None of this is on the American mind. Maybe I&aposm wrong, because this is on three cable networks, but it&aposs summertime. People are out doing stuff. They don&apost care. (CROSSTALK) BILA: I think Trump has made a point that was in the FBI, there has been an effort by some of those people, by some aspect of it to undermine him. And many pooh-poohed that and laughed at it and said it&aposs a big joke. And now you see a guy who is -- I don&apost know what more information you would need to not only show his bias but to show that there was intent here to do something about it. You don&apost say if I write a text to Jesse and say, oh, Juan is doing, you know, a terrible job on the show, and Jesse says, well, he just got renewed and I say we&aposll stop it. That means we&aposre going to try to stop you from getting renewed. That doesn&apost mean the American people are going to write letters and then try to make that happen. This was direct intent.  WILLIAMS: Well, I would just say in my own defense that it&aposs time for Sharknado. I think a lot of people would watch that show, just like they&aposre watching this silliness today, you know,  BILA: Well, also this guy forcing him to reenact those text.  (CROSSTALK) BILA: Great television.  WILLIAMS: Talk about jumping the shark.  PERINO: I mean, Jedediah, that&aposs the point. This wasn&apost supposed to be great television, it&aposs a congressional hearing.  BILA: I agree with you, but I do think it drove the point home on how horrifically biased those things that he was saying. When he in one breath is saying I wasn&apost bias, and when he had to reiterate that stuff everyone at home was like, come on, man.  WATTERS: Let&aposs remember, he was removed from the Mueller probe for bias. The I.G. says he was biased, and he&aposs being investigated still by the I.G. for bias. BILA: That&aposs a better point. WATTERS: And Rosenstein said he was bias.  WILLIAMS: And the I.G. report said what, Jesse? That it didn&apost affect his work.  WATTERS: They&aposve said it couldn&apost prove that it affected his work. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: Can we stop talking about it?  WATTERS: They&aposre breaking, we&aposre breaking, the hearing is in recess right now for the next 15, so we&aposre going to come back live when they&aposre back, All right. First, Trump shakes up NATO, defending his tough talk. The summit shock waves up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GUTFELD: All right, like an orange tornado, Donald Trump swept into the NATO summit. The expectation: total destruction. But hasn&apost anyone noticed a pattern? Not the media who monitor Trump with an infant&aposs temperament. It&aposs always the end of the world. Yet, why do we always feel fine? Could it be because tremendous progress has been made? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Tremendous progress has been made. Everyone has agreed to substantially up their commitment. They&aposre going to up it at levels that they&aposve never thought of before. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Never, never. So after all the noise, everything is calm again. And it seems like all Trump did was ask the other guys to pay their fair share. Fair share. Remember when the media loved that? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) FORMER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: It&aposs only right that we ask everyone to pay their fair share.  It was important for us to make sure that millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share. Making sure the wealthiest Americans begins to pay their fair share. (END VIDEO CLIPS) GUTFELD: But ask of that of your allies? Our media bristles. How dare us rubes ask our more sophisticated allies to chip in on the bill especially in public. It&aposs like when the dinner bill comes, it&aposs always that know-it-all at the table who darts to the restroom, leaving you to be the jerk to call him on it because he knows you won&apost. But he never expected that Trump would be at the table who would do it to his face because, frankly, he&aposs our jerk. Germany spends only 1.24 percent of its GDP on NATO, which was created to curb Soviet expansion. Meanwhile, Germany is pipelining with Putin. Talk about Soviet expansion. Since America is always left with the bill, maybe we can call Germany out for hiding in the john doing dirty deals when the check drops. Now, Trump wants defense spending at 4 percent GDP, twice with these countries already fail to meet. Why would he do that? Maybe to get them to meet the initial target. Could he be a stable genius?  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: I&aposm very consistent. I&aposm a very stable genius. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: So after all the tantrums, can&apost the media admit that Trump had a point? Now Putin is next, which means everyone on CNN will don their chicken suits and scream at the sky telling us it&aposs the end of the world, but only as they know it. Jed, another apocalypse averted it seems.  BILA: Oh, yes. I don&apost understand the outrage over this this. I really don&apost. I don&apost understand why is there a country that&aposs an ally of ours that isn&apost doing what they&aposre supposed to be doing, and we&aposre all supposed to be helping each other out and they&aposre not pulling their weight in a certain area, I get you have to be a little bit cautious with the language that you use, maybe, in the way you approach it. You don&apost want to jeopardize those relationships. But he&aposs the President of the United States. He is supposed to put America first. He is supposed to say, hey, guys, look, we&aposre all supposed to be helping each other out, and if you&aposre not giving the percentage that you&aposre supposed to be giving towards the spending and we are, you need to up it. That&aposs his job. That&aposs what he&aposs supposed to do.  WATTERS: He&aposs like the guy at the restaurant when the bill comes, he itemizes the bill. He&aposs like, well, no, you had steak. I only had an appetizer. I didn&apost drink. So, and that&aposs funny though. You know, the media loved when Obama went on the apology tour, and they hate this. I mean, this is just -- he wants to strengthen NATO and make sure everybody has skin in the game. I don&apost see why they have a problem with it at all.  GUTFELD: Let me ask Juan, is this that stereotype realize where you have this snooty European and the ugly American who comes over. WATTERS: He talks about money. GUTFELD: And talks about money and jingle change in his pants, you know what I mean?  WILLIAMS: No, no, no. Well, look, we have a stable genius.  GUTFELD: Yes. WILLIAMS: And the stable genius on our team goes over there and the context is what&aposs missing. I think from Jesse&aposs analysis because 97 to 2 is what the senate voted just this week to say we like NATO. The American public is like 69 percent NATO helps us in terms of international security. And guess what? We have here in a situation where the president comes out and says, oh, I have persuaded all these NATO allies now to up their spending. Emmanuel Macron comes out and says no, we just said we will hold to our existing promise. GUTFELD: Which is good. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: It&aposs just bluster.  GUTFELD: They&aposre lousy tippers, the French.  WATTERS: They are. He likes NATO. He just thinks he can get up better price for it.  GUTFELD: Dana, isn&apost that the key -- I mean, maybe I&aposm wrong. This is only my speculation is that to get them -- to get to the 2 percent.  PERINO: Yeah. I mean, it&aposs the art of the deal. You know you&aposre going to compromise.  GUTFELD: Yeah, yeah, yeah. PERINO: But I think what he is saying also is that if you think that you have a problem with Russia and I agree with you, if he does, we&aposll see.  GUTFELD: Right. PERINO: You have a problem, then you should put more towards your defense. The thing about that has bothered me about this, it&aposs not like there&aposs a big NATO pie. The percentages is what you spend on your own defense for your country. So it&aposs like -- that&aposs why they&aposre a little bit different. The Estonian GDP, we get 2 percent of Estonia&aposs GDP, like, really -- we&aposve just made that in an hour in the United States. So, it&aposs all like leading up to it. I think on the Putin thing was very interesting and I would watch for it is -- you have Netanyahu go to Putin the other day and say I want you to make a deal with us -- let us deal with Syria and take you out of the picture, and let us have Iran.  GUTFELD: Isn&apost it -- isn&apost that pipeline thing a little squirrely? It&aposs Stroders behind it, isn&apost he?  WATTERS: Yes. So they have this pipeline -- should have gone through Ukraine, instead it goes right to the sea, right through Russia. And it shouldn&apost.  PERINO: Well, part of the reason. WATTERS: . gone through Ukraine. PERINO: But part of the reason the Ukrainians didn&apost want it is they didn&apost want the Russians to get to put their pipeline through Ukraine.  WATTERS: You get transmission fees when it goes through Ukraine.  WILLIAMS: Let me just tell you -- and also that deal was struck in 2000, way before of all the trouble. WATTERS: I know. WILLIAMS: So you have a different context, Jesse.  WATTERS: I agree. They should buy it from us. GUTFELD: Exactly. Ukraine, I crane, we all crane.  WILLIAMS: By the way, do you really want Germany to have a strong military?  WATTERS: Oh, Juan.  GUTFELD: Fair point. The explosive bombshell that has liberals foaming at the mouth over President Trump&aposs Supreme Court nominee, that&aposs next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: If you thought the left attacks against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh were already bad, wait until you hear these ridiculous attempts at a smear campaign.  In a Washington Post headline, ""The Elite World of Brett Kavanaugh,"" we learn, quote, ""In Kavanaugh&aposs Georgetown Prep yearbook, he listed himself as the treasurer of the &aposKeg City Club -- 100 Kegs or Bust.&apos""  Another Post headline reveals ""Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh piled up credit card debt by purchasing Nationals tickets, White House says.""  And pro-choice group NARAL tweeting, ""Well, we&aposll be damned if we&aposre going to let five men, including some frat boy named Brett, strip us of our hard- won bodily autonomy and reproductive rights. #StopKavanaugh #SaveRoe.""  Stephen Colbert also doing some mudslinging.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEPHEN COLBERT, HOST, CBS&aposS ""THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT"": I don&apost know much about Kavanaugh, but I&aposm skeptical, because his name is Brett. That sounds less like a Supreme Court justice and more like a waiter at Ruby Tuesday&aposs.  (END VIDEO CLIP) PERINO: Jesse, this is all they have?  JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST: I guess so. I mean, it sounds like he&aposs likable. He likes baseball and likes to drink.  PERINO: And also, Juan, you&aposve got to like a guy who went into a little bit of credit card debt to get Nationals tickets. It&aposs worth it.  WILLIAMS: Mrs. Williams, you didn&apost hear that. I&aposm a big Nationals fan and I have season tickets. So -- PERINO: He has been a government employee for almost his entire adult career.  WILLIAMS: Of course, he lives in a much better neighborhood than I do. I mean, he lives in a great neighborhood.  But so what? You know what? But I think this is so much fun. I mean, at this point, they&aposre just having fun, because the real thing is can the Democrats stop him? Delay or stop it? Can they stop the hearings or at least delay them? And that&aposs the real argument that&aposs going on. So all this is, like, frivolity at this point. And by the way, the Nationals this year are not worth the money.  JEDEDIAH BILA, CO-HOST: Juan, why do Democrats do this? It reminds me of Mitt Romney and they&aposre running articles about how Mitt Romney bullied a kid in prep school. And it seems like Democrats do this often when there&aposs not -- like talk about a guy&aposs record, Kavanaugh. I take issue with one of the tax-related cases Mark Levin was talking about the other night, how he argued that the mandate for the Affordable Care Act was a tax and not a penalty. Talk about that. Take issue with that.  Why did they go into this nonsense that depletes that whole argument? It makes people say, ""You guys are just swimming, looking for something.""  WILLIAMS: I think they will get into it. I think that this moment, that&aposs just where we are, Jedediah. I mean, it&aposs like yesterday, there were these wonderful pictures of him with his family when he announced when he was -- the nomination was announced and he spoke in the East Room of the White House.  And then there were articles about, what does it mean when men show off their women as part of their resume, the $2 and the wonderful wife. And I thought this is ridiculous. Leave the guy alone. But you know what? They are going to talk about the record. It&aposs not only the tax records; it&aposs surveillance.  PERINO: Commercial break talk.  Greg, what you think. Is this good for Brett Kavanaugh? That he -- GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Yes. PERINO: -- is a normal guy? GUTFELD: Beer kegs, baseball, and debt. You can&apost get more -- you can&apost get more American than that. This is a new era where you&aposre going to get younger nominees who are from a generation where they use party as a verb and not a noun. And I&aposm older than this guy, and I&aposm older than the previous guy, and my hobbies were not this benign.  WATTERS: You&aposre older than the Supreme Court --  GUTFELD: I&aposm older than two of them. So we&aposre going to be in an era. Think about 10 years from now, 20 years. The permanence of social media, everyone is going to have a paper trail. The Supreme Court is going to show up. They&aposre going to have sorority pictures. PERINO: ""What did you mean when you tweeted --""  GUTFELD: Exactly.  WATTERS: I don&apost remember tweeting that. GUTFELD: How much are those tickets? That&aposs a lot.  PERINO: But remember, he&aposs been a government employee for 20 years.  GUTFELD: But it&aposs -- you&aposve got baseball. You&aposve got debt. You&aposve got beer. I bet he -- if they find out that he runs an apple pie smuggling ring, that will be amazing.  WILLIAMS: He goes to a great Catholic church attended by more of the Washington elites and he hangs out at a --  BILA: Oh, my gosh.  WATTERS: And he was serving homeless people hot meals the other day at a soup kitchen.  GUTFELD: It was too hot.  WATTERS: It burned the homeless guy&aposs tongue. PERINO: It is like weekend at Kavanaugh&aposs, Supreme Court addition.  We&aposre waiting for the hearings to resume on Capitol Hill. We&aposll bring it to you live when they&aposre back.  But first, facial recognition is a hot new craze, but there&aposs more than meets the eye. What you should know before opting in.  GUTFELD: Puns.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WILLIAMS: Welcome back to ""The Five."" You&aposre going to see more of the wild and hairy congressional hearings, Peter Strzok hearings, resume any minute. But before then, we&aposll give you some entertainment. We will give it to you live what it does resume, though.  In the meantime, you might think that the new facial recognition tools are cool, but they could come at a big cost, a surveillance state. The new technology can apparently land you in trouble for anything from jaywalking to traffic violations and far more.  Social media companies like Facebook use it to help tag users in photos, but consumer groups and advocates say it may violate your privacy, because it names people without their consent. Jedediah, there was a front-page piece in The New York Times this week talking about how the Chinese government is using this kind of technology to spy on people in public places doing ordinary things.  Does this upset you?  BILA: Very scary, and this is why I wrote -- I&aposm about to pull a Gutfeld - - this is why I wrote the book ""#DoNotDisturb: How I Ghosted My Cell Phone to Take Back My Life."" I actually wrote a lot of this.  WILLIAMS: When does it come out? BILA: Comes out October 9. But the preorder is available now. But I wrote this because this stuff with facial recognition, with fingerprinting, is getting really, really scary. Because A, the stuff could be hacked. B, you never know if a third party is going to acquire the data and what they&aposre going to do with it.  And oftentimes, you don&apost even realize that you are having these photos taken of you or you are part of the system, because you have to opt out. It&aposs not that you have to give your consent to opt in. You have to know that they&aposre automatically scanning my face, I&aposm automatically part of this, and I have to go search and figure out how to opt out of this feature.  People don&apost know that. They assume that, if they haven&apost signed up for something like this, they&aposre not participating.  GUTFELD: A problem with facial recognition. What if you look a lot like someone? I&aposll be able to access Brad Pitt&aposs bank accounts.  PERINO: I mean, that&aposs going to be a huge problem. GUTFELD: Yes. WATTERS: I&aposm going to get hit with fines for David Schwimmer running red lights.  WILLIAMS: But here&aposs what -- here&aposs what really surprised me about this. They can go into a supermarket. So Jesse is in the supermarket, and he&aposs buying soup. And they can say, ""Hey, that&aposs Jesse Watters. Not your -- your Doppler [SIC]. That&aposs Jesse Watters. He likes Campbell soup. And if you give him a discount right now, Jesse will buy more.""  You think, why are they doing this? Why are they using this technology?  WATTERS: They&aposre doing that to make money, Juan. It&aposs like whenever you Google something, and then two minutes later there&aposs an ad that pops up that is exactly what you were looking at.  GUTFELD: It&aposs so embarrassing. Especially at work.  WILLIAMS: What were you looking for, Gregory?  GUTFELD: Exactly. WATTERS: Ads popping up over there. GUTFELD: Yes. WATTERS: Listen, I like it for terrorism. Like, I could see putting them in airports or train stations or in Times Square, but you can only use it to fight terrorism.  I don&apost like it when you can get hit for jaywalking or for running a red light. I like the cat and mouse with police. You know, it&aposs like they should be able to catch you running the red light personally. They shouldn&apost be able to use red light cameras. That&aposs just not fair.  PERINO: Did this happen to you recently?  WATTERS: I&aposm getting a lot of red-light camera tickets. WILLIAMS: So Dana, six years ago the Europeans asked them to stop this. ""Don&apost do it."" And what we&aposve seen is especially after Zuckerberg testified earlier in the year, declining confidence in Facebook in the American public because of things like this.  PERINO: I think -- The New York Times story about China affected me because in some ways, you think it&aposs convenient. A friend of mine -- I talked to her last night -- she lives in Abu Dhabi. She&aposs an American there. Her husband is in our military.  And she got in a car accident. And they -- she called the police, and they said, ""Oh, are you in the white Acura? We&aposre seeing it now."" So the cameras are everywhere.  But what&aposs happening in China is even worse. They&aposll find out, like, you&aposre walking down the street. Like, oh, that guy right there, they&aposll put your face up on a bulletin board, big debt. Right in front of -- and publicly shaming people. So it&aposs a way to control --  WATTERS: Is it Kavanaugh they caught?  WILLIAMS: That&aposs a liberal joke. That&aposs a liberal joke. PERINO: I think the allure of a lot of this is it adds to convenience, and it helps you get things done, but then the danger is when it tips over onto the other side.  GUTFELD: Can I just make one point real quickly? Privacy is overrated. I think we should let everybody know everything. You know, before you get exposed, expose yourself.  WILLIAMS: Wow. OK. Peter Strzok just sat back down at the congressional hearings. We&aposre going to take you back to that live. Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

19,2018-05-25 00:00:00,2018,5.0,25,Associated Press,2 N. Korean diplomats behind US summit back-and-forth,"SEOUL, South Korea –  An aging North Korean nuclear strategist involved in now-dormant disarmament deals. His former interpreter in international negotiations who is now North Korea&aposs highest-ranking female diplomat. Kim Kye Gwan and Choe Son Hui are among the best-known North Korean officials after leader Kim Jong Un and his family members. They are in the news again now after their recent back-to-back comments about the United States were blamed for President Donald Trump&aposs abrupt cancellation on Thursday of a much-anticipated summit with Kim Jong Un. On Friday, Trump said the two sides were working to put the meeting back on track. A look at who the officials are and how their comments led Trump to spike the summit planned for June 12 in Singapore: ___ KIM KYE GWAN First Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Gwan, 75, led the North Korean delegation at much of the off-and-on six-nation nuclear disarmament talks held in Beijing in 2003-2008. In the talks among the two Koreas, the United States, China, Russia and Japan, he was known for seeking a series of concessions in return for slow disarmament steps. South Korean media called his strategy ""salami tactics,"" comparing it to cutting thin slices off a salami. Under the agreements reached in the negotiations, North Korea halted atomic activities and disabled key elements of its weapons program in return for security guarantees, shipments of fuel and other aid. But the deals eventually collapsed amid disputes over how to verify the North&aposs disarmament steps. Criticism subsequently flared in Washington, Seoul and elsewhere that the deals only benefited North Korea. In recent months, Kim Kye Gwan, who was also a senior member of the ruling Workers&apos Party and a delegate to the rubber-stamp parliament, has been rarely mentioned in state media, triggering speculation that he might be ill. On May 16, however, he issued a statement threatening to scuttle the Kim-Trump summit to protest what he called Washington&aposs push for one-sided disarmament. That tossed fuel on skepticism in the U.S. about whether North Korea truly intends to deal away its nuclear program. ___ CHOE SON HUI Also a vice foreign minister, Choe, about 54, is one of the few women who hold high-level posts in North Korea&aposs male-dominated ruling elite. Other high-profile women include Kim Jong Un&aposs sister, Kim Yo Jong, who is in charge of the North&aposs propaganda affairs, and his young, popular wife, Ri Sol Ju. Reportedly a stepdaughter of former Premier Choe Yong Rim, Choe Son Hui worked as an English-language interpreter for Kim Kye Gwan during the six-party talks after studying in Austria and China. She then headed the North American Affairs Bureau at the Foreign Ministry before a state media dispatch in March confirmed her promotion to vice foreign minister. Seoul&aposs Unification Ministry says Choe is the highest-ranking woman in North Korea&aposs Foreign Ministry. On Thursday, she grabbed international headlines by calling U.S. Vice President Mike Pence a ""political dummy"" and threatening to scrap the Kim-Trump summit. ""Whether the U.S. will meet us at a meeting room or encounter us at nuclear-to-nuclear showdown is entirely dependent upon the decision and behavior of the United States,"" she said. This directly led Trump to say it was ""inappropriate"" to go ahead with the summit because of the ""tremendous anger and open hostility"" displayed in the North&aposs ""most recent statement."" Kim Kye Gwan tried quickly to calm the situation, saying in a statement that North Korea is still willing to hold talks with the United States ""at any time, in any format.""",https://www.foxnews.com/us/2-n-korean-diplomats-behind-us-summit-back-and-forth,MILITARY,Fox News

Federal prosecutors and a U.N.-backed mission on corruption asked the country&aposs Supreme Court on Wednesday to issue arrest warrants for 38 politicians and officials. The accused allegedly took money from the agriculture department and channeled it through foundations or non-governmental groups to Hernandez&aposs National Party, the opposition Liberal Party and a smaller third party. Part of the funds were allegedly used to finance so-called ""Cachureca"" cards — discount cards that were handed out as part of Hernandez&aposs campaign.

21,2018-07-04 00:00:00,2018,7.0,4,Associated Press,Nauru criticized for banning Australian state broadcaster,"CANBERRA, Australia –  Nauru has been accused of restricting press freedom by banning an Australian state-owned broadcaster from attending an international forum that the tiny Pacific atoll-nation will host in September. Australians have a particular interest in Nauru because their government pays the impoverished nation of fewer than 10,000 people to house asylum seekers who attempt to reach Australia by boat. The United Nations and human rights groups have criticized the arrangement as well as the conditions that asylum seekers endure there. Australia&aposs Federal Parliamentary Press Gallery, Canberra&aposs equivalent of the White House press corps, on Wednesday threatened to boycott the Pacific Islands Forum leaders&apos summit on Nauru unless Australian Broadcasting Corp. was allowed to attend. ""The decision by the government of Nauru to pick and choose the journalists who cover the Pacific Islands Forum is an appalling restriction on press freedom,"" the gallery&aposs president David Crowe said in a statement. Nauru had announced the ban on Monday, citing among its reasons the Australian Broadcasting Corp.&aposs ""blatant interference in Nauru&aposs domestic politics"" and ""continued biased and false reporting about our country."" ABC director Gaven Morris said in a statement the Nauru government should not be allowed to dictate which Australian media attend the summit, which is held annually in different member nations. Nauru described Morris&aposs statement as arrogant and disrespectful and said press freedom had not been restricted. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who will represent the largest of the 18 Pacific nations in the forum, supported the Nauru government&aposs right to ban the ABC. ""It&aposll be regrettable not having (Australian) media at the Pacific Islands Forum, but we must respect Nauru&aposs sovereignty to determine who comes into their country. We support press freedom, but it is a matter for Nauru,"" Turnbull tweeted. The New Zealand Parliament Press Gallery has condemned the ABC ban as ""a clear violation of freedom of expression."" Australian opposition leader Bill Shorten said he was disappointed to see Turnbull ""run up the white flag"" and that Australia&aposs public broadcaster should be allowed to report on Turnbull&aposs activities overseas. Damien Kingsbury, a Deakin University expert on international politics, said the asylum seekers kept on Nauru were at the core of the dispute. ""The ABC has been pretty forthright in its critical reporting of the asylum seeker issue in relation to Nauru and this is an extension of that,"" Kingsbury said. ""Clearly the Australian government doesn&apost want to annoy the government of Nauru,"" he added. The United States has promised to resettle up to 1,250 refugees that Australia has banished to Nauru and the poor South Pacific island nation of Papua New Guinea.",https://www.foxnews.com/world/nauru-criticized-for-banning-australian-state-broadcaster,World,Fox News
22,2018-07-24 00:00:00,2018,7.0,24,Alex Pappas,New details emerge on race to save Otto Warmbier,"close Video Negotiator's firsthand account of dealing with North Korea Mickey Bergman, executive director of the Richardson Center for Global Engagement, was part of the negotiations that eventually brought Otto Warmbier home. New details are being reported about the secret efforts to secure the release of American college student Otto Warmbier, who suffered brain damage and died after being held captive in North Korea for 15 months after an ill-fated trip to the country in 2015. According to  a lengthy article published in GQ’s August issue , President Trump signed off on the secret State Department mission in June 2017 to send an American plane to North Korea to retrieve Warmbier after learning the University of Virginia student was unconscious. “Take care of Otto,” Trump reportedly told then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. According to the account, North Korea was ""unilaterally informed"" that the American plane carrying diplomats and doctors would be landing in Pyongyang for the mission. Warmbier’s parents still held out hope their son was asleep or in a medically induced coma, GQ reported, even after told by their home state senator, Republican Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, that he appeared to have severe brain damage. Otto Warmbier's parents open up about son's death Otto Warmbier's parents give first interview since the death of their son, days after his release from a North Korean prison But when his parents met the plane carrying their son at an airport in Cincinnati, they were shocked at what they saw: A vegetative Warmbier was howling “inhuman” sounds as he jerked violently against the straps of his stretcher. His eyes were open, but he was not communicative. Doctors could not determine what caused the injury. But the theories began to spread that Warmbier had been tortured while in captivity – theories embraced by his parents and the president himself. Video The New York Times  was first to cite an anonymous official i n June 2017 to report that the government “obtained intelligence reports in recent weeks indicating that Mr. Warmbier had been repeatedly beaten while in North Korean custody.” Speaking to Fox News in September 2017, Warmbier’s father Fred described seeing his son in the vegetative state and said, “It looked like someone had taken a pair of pliers and re-arranged his bottom teeth.” Trump tweeted that same day: “Otto was tortured beyond belief by North Korea.” But the GQ article cited a coroner’s report and quotes from intelligence experts to cast doubt on the claims. A  coroner who examined Warmbier , Lakshmi Kode Sammarco, said she observed “no obvious signs of torture.” “Of the dozen experts I spoke to, only a single one thought there was even a remote likelihood that he had been beaten,” journalist Doug Bock Clark wrote in the GQ piece. Clark also said a senior-level American official told him, “In general, the intel reports were wrong, as the medical examinations have shown.”  Asked Tuesday by Fox News whether the administration believes Warmbier was tortured, a State Department spokesman told Fox News: ""We hold North Korea accountable for Otto Warmbier’s unjust imprisonment."" The GQ article said the Warmbiers declined to comment for the story. Fox News attempted to reach the family Tuesday through McGuire Woods, the Virginia law firm that has represented the family, but has not heard back. In June, after his historic summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Trump said the meeting between the two leaders may not have happened if not for the death of Warmbier. “Otto did not die in vain,” Trump said. Warmbier’s parents responded by saying they hope “something positive” can come from the summit. “We appreciate President Trump&aposs recent comments about our family,” Fred and Cindy Warmbier said in a statement. “We are proud of Otto and miss him. Hopefully something positive can come from this.”",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-details-emerge-on-race-to-save-otto-warmbier,White House,Fox News

          Johnnie Wilson ""Jack"" Barto, a pediatrician from Johnstown, Pennsylvania, is accused of molesting more than two dozen young patients over several years.
           (Cambria County Prison) A 70-year-old Pennsylvania pediatrician sexually abused more than two dozen young patients, sometimes while their parents were still in the room, police said. Johnnie Wilson “Jack” Barto, of Johnstown, allegedly assaulted both boys and girls, mostly ranging in ages from 8 to 12, the  Pennsylvania state attorney general’s office  announced Monday. One victim was an infant and another was 21 months old, officials said. The abuse, police said, could have spanned decades. “Barto used his position of authority as a pediatrician – the family doctor everyone relied on to treat and heal their children – and abused it to feed his own, sick sexual desires,” Attorney General Josh Shapiro said in a statement. Barto allegedly either waited for the patients’ parents to leave an exam room or used his body as a shield to block parents’ view when he carried out the assaults, police said. He would also say the assaults were part of the routine medical examination, investigators said. The attorney general’s office said Barto would digitally penetrate young girls – without wearing gloves – when they came in for ailments such as the flu or migraines. Some of the alleged assaults happened as recently as January, Shapiro said, but could have begun in the 1980s. FORMER UCLA STAR ARRESTED FOR ALLEGED CHILD SEX ABUSE BEFORE DEATH The  charges , which include indecent assault, aggravated indecent assault and child endangerment, come months after he was arrested on related charges. In January, he was accused of touching a 12-year-old female patient inappropriately,  the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review reported . A relative later told investigators that when she was 14, she fell asleep during a family gathering and woke up as Barto was inappropriately touching her,  according to the Tribune-Review . “Barto used his position of authority as a pediatrician – the family doctor everyone relied on to treat and heal their children – and abused it to feed his own, sick sexual desires.” — Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro “Every parent sends their child to a pediatrician to make sure they are healthy and getting the care they need. Parents rely on those doctors to examine their children, give them medical advice, and guide them as they try to do their best for their children,” Shapiro said. “Barto violated every tenet of his oath as a doctor and as a decent human being – violating the trust of his victims, their parents and of the entire community.” LARRY NASSAR SENTENCED TO 40 TO 175 YEARS IN GYMNASTICS MOLESTATION CASE The Johnstown Tribune-Democrat reported that Barto was accused of sexually molesting two female patients in 1998, but he was never criminally charged and denied the allegations. Ultimately, the Board of Medicine determined that he could keep his license, citing a lack of evidence. A woman confronted Barto in 2017 after the doctor made her wait outside the room while he examined her son&aposs genitals, although the 12-year-old was only suffering from the flu, police said. The woman returned to see the doctor fondling her son, police said, so she “immediately confronted” Barto, who walked away without offering any explanation. A girl who was about 16 told her mother, herself a physician, that Barto had inappropriately touched her during an exam in 1997, police said. When the mother confronted Barto in the presence of the office manager, he “promised he would never examine a female patient again,” according to police. Barto’s license was suspended in January, and his bail has been set at $1 million. When the new charges were announced, Barto was already in prison. MOM SAYS SHE WAS IN EXAM ROOM WHEN LARRY NASSAR SEXUALLY ABUSED DAUGHTER The attorney general’s office has created a special hotline related to the case for victims or parents to call: 412-565-7680. They can also contact the Richland Township Police at 814-266-8333. “I want to thank the brave survivors who have come forward and shared with our investigators their traumatizing experiences at the hands of Dr. Barto,” Shapiro said. “I have a message for these courageous individuals, and for any person or institution that believes they can get away with sexually abusing children and covering it up. We will pursue every allegation of child sexual abuse wherever we find it – in a doctor’s office, in a school or church – and we will hold child sexual predators accountable for their crimes under Pennsylvania law.” Shapiro&aposs office said Barto could spend the rest of his life in prison if he is convicted. Johnstown is a little more than 60 miles east of Pittsburgh.

Justify made racing history Saturday with his victory in the Belmont Stakes, becoming only the 13th Triple Crown champion and the first since American Pharoah won the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Belmont Stakes in 2015. The crowd was enthusiastic, appreciative and thrilled to witness the second Triple Crown winner in four years. After American Pharoah became the first Triple Crown winner in 37 years, Sports Illustrated published a cover photo that showed a packed apron on a gorgeous day at Belmont Park. In the background of the photo was American Pharoah crossing the finish line. In the foreground were hundreds of people, all with their phones raised, doing their best to capture in a split-second a moment of history. Even people who bet against American Pharoah were happy to trade losing money for witnessing the elusive accomplishment. Unanimity, or near unanimity, is a rare thing in horse racing. The very essence of pari-mutuel wagering is that I bet against you in the same pool, and if I win, I get your money. It’s the customers’ money – not the house’s – that supplies the payoffs. Strong opinions are currency; and a big payout is not uncommonly accompanied by a trace of smugness. In that way, horse racing may not be all that different from politics – another activity in which participants revel in disagreement, crow about being right, and can get big payouts if they pick a winner. Fortunately, most racetrack disputes end with even the defeated offering a grudging respect for the winners. Even the people who bet against Justify on Saturday appreciated the prodigious accomplishments of an uncommonly gifted racehorse. And even though “the horse race” has become a conventional metaphor for an election cycle, the grace that often accompanies losing hasn’t quite transferred to the political arena. In the mid-20th century, when horse racing was the most popular sport in the country and when it began to be televised widely, horses like Seabiscuit and Native Dancer captured the country’s imagination. These horses appeared on mainstream magazine covers, and after four Triple Crown winners in the 1940s the sport’s audience fixated on the quest for the next horse that could win the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness and the Belmont Stakes. As the overall popularity of racing declined with the rise of other legal forms of betting, most people in the U.S. would pay attention to horse racing only at the beginning of May, with the Kentucky Derby. They’d stick around for two weeks, and if the Derby winner faltered in the Preakness, they turned their attention elsewhere until the next year. If a horse came to Belmont having won the first two legs, attention became frenzied, with more than 100,000 people coming out in the early years of the 21st century, hoping to see history made. That’s why after American Pharoah won the Triple Crown attendance at horse races didn’t increase by any significant number. Even a Triple Crown winner doesn’t have the ability to build a mass audience, and the buzz accompanying this year’s attempt was far more muted than it was three years ago. There was one pretty much sure bet on the day: that when it was over, we’d go back to our respective camps, in the hope, maybe, of getting another chance to come together next year.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/justifys-triple-crown-win-brings-us-together-to-admire-an-uncommonly-gifted-horse,OPINION,Fox News

Warner jokes about revealing Russia probe info Democratic ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee reportedly jokes about Russia probe, tells donors to 'buckle up'; reaction on 'The Story' from Jonathan Swan, national political reporter for Axios. President Donald Trump on Monday wondered aloud if Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner was in a “near drunken state” when he reportedly told donors he could spill the secrets about the investigation into the Trump campaign’s alleged collusion with Russia. “Why is Senator Mark Warner (D-VA), perhaps in a near drunken state, claiming he has information that only he and Bob Mueller, the leader of the 13 Angry Democrats on a Witch Hunt, knows?” Trump tweeted. “Isn’t this highly illegal. Is it being investigated?” The president was referring to a reported joke Warner, the ranking member on the Senate Intelligence Committee, made at a high-dollar Democratic Party’s retreat on Martha’s Vineyard on Friday.  Politico reported  that Warner was overheard saying, “If you get me one more glass of wine, I’ll tell you stuff only Bob Mueller and I know,” Warner reportedly joked last Friday, Politico reported. “If you think you’ve seen wild stuff so far, buckle up.

         Image 2 of 2 HELSINKI –  The summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin will be held at one of the Finnish president&aposs official residences in Helsinki, a palace that overlooks the Baltic Sea where the presidents&apos predecessors have met, officials in Finland said Friday. The office of Finnish President Sauli Niinisto said Trump and Putin would meet on Monday at the 19th century Presidential Palace, located a stone&aposs throw away from the capital&aposs iconic waterfront Market Square. Putin and Trump have met twice before on the sidelines of international meetings. The Helsinki summit will be their first official stand-alone meeting. U.S. President George H.W. Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev held talks at the same venue in 1990. Trump and first lady Melania Trump are scheduled to start the day joining Niinisto and his spouse, Jenni Haukio, for breakfast at Mantyniemi, another presidential residence in Helsinki where the couple lives most of the time. Niinisto also will hold a bilateral meeting with Putin. Finland, a Nordic nation of 5.5 million, has a long legacy of hosting U.S.-Soviet and U.S. Russian summits due to its geographic location and perceived neutrality. The last time a summit brought presidential entourages from Moscow and Washington to Helsinki was in March 1997. Presidents Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin held talks on arms control and NATO expansion. U.S. Marine Corps Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, met with Gen. Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the Russian military&aposs General Staff, in a manor house owned by the Finnish state in June to exchange views on U.S.-Russia military relations, Syria and international security. Along with the presidents, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov are set to meet at the Presidential Palace on Monday. Researcher Sari Autio-Sarasmo at the University of Helsinki&aposs Aleksanteri Institute said the Finnish capital and Vienna, the capital of Austria, were important conduits between the East and the West during the Cold War. While both European cities were centers of espionage, Helsinki specialized in relaying information and acting as a go-between for world&aposs two superpowers. ""As a member of the European Union, Finland doesn&apost anymore emphasize its neutrality, but strong expertise, particularly on Russia, and good location make Finland a very useful meeting place,"" said Autio-Sarasmo, who specializes in studying Cold War history. U.S. President Gerald Ford and Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev met in Helsinki in 1975 to sign the landmark Helsinki Accords, a watershed commitment to peace, security and human rights. Finland joined the European Union in 1995, but has remained outside of NATO as a militarily non-aligned nation in a similar way as close Nordic neighbor Sweden. The 3,000-square-meter (32,292-square-foot) Presidential Palace, which underwent a major renovation completed in 2015, has hosted prominent guests who aren&apost politicians during its eventful past, including Britain&aposs Queen Elizabeth II and the late (now a saint) Pope John Paul II. It was built for a wealthy Finnish merchant in the early 19th century on grounds that formerly held a salt store house. After Finland was integrated into Russia&aposs Czarist Empire as an independent Grand Duchy in 1809 after being part of the Kingdom of Sweden for nearly 700 years, the building was completed in 1845 at the request of Emperor Nicholas I and became the Imperial Palace. Key rooms were modeled after the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg, the official residence of Russian monarchs. Russian Emperor Alexander II visited the palace several times. He was popular with Finns due to his policies sympathetic to Finland. During World War I, the grand residence temporarily housed a military hospital. Following Finland&aposs independence from Russia in 1917, it was officially renamed the Presidential Palace in 1921. The palace now is the working residence of Finland&aposs president. It currently houses the Office of the President and is the venue for official events. ___ Olsen reported from Copenhagen, Denmark.",https://www.foxnews.com/world/finland-trump-putin-summit-to-be-at-presidential-palace,World,Fox News

The defense for Paul Manafort rested their case Tuesday without calling the ex-Trump campaign chairman to the stand to testify in the bank and tax fraud case against him. Addressing the court for the first time during his trial, Manafort stood up and told Judge T.S. Ellis III that he did not want to testify. After two weeks of testimony from prosecution witnesses, until now it had been unclear whether the defense would put forward witnesses or evidence of their own. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team rested their case Monday afternoon. “We believe the government has failed to meet their burden of proof and we’ve rested on that,” Manafort defense attorney Kevin Downing told reporters outside court. Video The trial now heads to closing arguments, set to begin Wednesday morning. Ellis told both sides to limit those arguments to one and a half hours each. PROSECUTION RESTS CASE IN MANAFORT CASE Manafort, 69, is facing tax evasion and bank fraud charges after being accused of hiding income earned from his Ukrainian work from the IRS. He’s also accused of fraudulently obtaining millions in bank loans. Manafort has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Ellis on Tuesday also ruled against the defense’s motion to acquit. The trial was delayed for two hours Tuesday after the morning proceedings began under seal and were closed to the public and press.  Before the trial adjourned for the day, the court took part in what’s called a charging conference - where the judge and lawyers from both sides discussed what the judge would tell the jury before deliberations. Ellis, who has not shied from making colorful comments during the trial, signaled that he will tell the jury to disregard any comments he made during witness testimony that might have shown his opinion. “Do you think I made any comments,” Ellis asked both sides. After a short silence, prosecutor Greg Andres stood and said, “Yes.” There was audible laughter in the courtroom. Last week, the prosecution’s star witness, Rick Gates – Manafort’s former business partner who struck a plea deal to cooperate with the government -- testified that he and Manafort committed bank and tax fraud together. On Monday, James Brennan, the vice president of The Federal Savings Bank, testified under immunity about a loan the bank gave Manafort. According to Brennan, the bank approved $16 million in loans to Manafort by CEO Stephen Calk, who was angling for a cabinet position in the Trump administration. When asked by prosecutor Greg Andres if he thought the loan should have been approved, Brennan replied, “My recommendation was the loan not be made.” Brennan said the loan was approved because of Calk. He said the Federal Savings Bank ended up losing $11.8 million on the loan. The prosecution had been expected to rest on Friday. But Ellis mysteriously delayed testimony in the case for five hours on Friday. The postponement was significant, as prosecutors had been hoping to finish calling witnesses Friday -- and Ellis has a reputation as a stickler for keeping trials moving. Manafort’s legal troubles won’t end with this trial. He is also facing charges in a separate federal court case in Washington, including conspiring against the United States, conspiring to launder money, failing to register as an agent of a foreign principal and providing false statements.

Lindsey Graham presses DOJ on role of Strzok, Page in Russia probe","close Video Graham seeks answers from Rosenstein on Russia investigation Republican member of the Senate Judiciary Committee Sen. Lindsey Graham joins 'The Story' with questions he wants Rod Rosenstein to answer. Sen. Lindsey Graham sent a letter Tuesday to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein asking the Justice Department to answer questions regarding the role of embattled FBI agent Peter Strzok and attorney Lisa Page in the launch of the investigation into Russian ties to the Trump campaign. As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is set to interview Strzok behind closed doors Wednesday, Graham told Fox News’ Martha MacCallum that based on DOJ Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz’s report and testimony from last week, Strzok and Page appeared to be “in the tank for Clinton and hated Trump.”   Graham's Letter to Rosenstein  by  Fox News  on Scribd 
 Horowitz wrote in his report that he found no bias in the decision from federal prosecutors not to bring charges against Clinton. Speaking after the report&aposs release, FBI Director Christopher Wray said, “The report does identify errors of judgment, violations of or disregard for policy, and decisions that, at the very least, in hindsight, were not the best choices,” but added that “nothing in the report impugns the integrity of our workforce as a whole, or the FBI as an institution.” “The evidence contained in Mr. Horowitz’s report shows an overwhelming bias against then-candidate Donald Trump,” Graham, R-S.C., wrote. “In particular, Peter Strzok, the head agent in charge of the Clinton email investigation, and Lisa Page, a top FBI attorney, exchanged message after message showing extreme bias against Donald Trump and a willingness to use their positions at FBI to ensure that he not get elected.”  The senator told Fox News&apos  “The Story”  that he now “understands why Mueller fired” Strzok. “You&aposve got to remember that the people we are looking at here hated Trump and I think they were all in the tank for Clinton and we’ll see what Mr. Mueller says, but I do know this -- the primary investigator when it comes to the Russian-Trump connection early on was Mr. Strzok, who was clearly in the tank for Clinton and hated Trump.” PETER STRZOK HEADING TO HILL FOR CLOSED-DOOR INTERVIEW WITH HOUSE LAWMAKERS Graham,  who penned a similar letter  last week, is asking the DOJ to answer the following questions, pertaining to their role in the use of informants and the surveillance warrant for a Trump adviser: 1.      Did Strzok or Page have any role in retaining or supervising the informant or directing the decision to use the informant? Did Strzok or Page have any such role as to any informant used to investigate the Trump camp or Trump associates? 2.      Did Strzok or Page have any role in reviewing, approving, or supplying information for the FISA warrant obtained to surveil Carter Page?

         Image 2 of 2 SEOUL, South Korea –  The on-again, off-again meeting between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has been an emotional roller coaster for South Koreans, who now await Tuesday&aposs historic summit with both hope and doubt. The hope is that improved relations between Washington and Pyongyang will ease tensions and dispel the threat of war, which has hung over the region for more than a half-century. But having seen North Korea go back on its word in the past, such as when it broke a previous nuclear pact in 2002, South Koreans remain cautious about the sudden breeze of peace blowing across their divided peninsula. ""North Korea&aposs willingness for talks seems clear now. The problem is that we are not so sure what they ultimately want,"" said graduate student Kim Jae-hak. For him, the ideal outcome would be a formal declaration to the end the Korean War, followed by the complete denuclearization of North Korea. He warned, however, that high expectations can bring great disappointment, so Koreans should watch how things unfold. South Korea&aposs government has been careful to avoid rash comments or hasty interpretations of the seesaw developments in the lead-up to the summit in Singapore. Still, South Korean President Moon Jae-in has made negotiations with North Korea a centerpiece of his administration and has a lot riding on next week&aposs events. Moon took office in May 2017 with a pledge to seek improved relations and ultimately peace with North Korea. In April, he met the North&aposs leader, Kim Jong Un, for talks at the Demilitarized Zone dividing their countries and the two set foot in one another&aposs countries, if only for a moment. Moon&aposs patient, yet determined diplomacy has been key to setting up the Trump and Kim meeting. It was Moon who presented Trump with the initial offer of a summit with Kim. After Trump accepted and then canceled, Moon worked to get it back on track by holding another meeting with Kim. ""It is critically important for President Moon Jae-in that the Trump-Moon summit goes well,"" said John Delury, associate professor of East Asian studies at Yonsei University in Seoul. Moon has ""staked a lot of political capital in getting the U.S. and North Korea to move together in a positive way just like the two Koreas have done."" The Singapore meeting would only be the start of a long process, Delury stressed. Reducing the threat of conflict is the initial goal, he said, which would be followed by cultural, humanitarian and economic steps. ""A successful Singapore (meeting) gives more room for President Moon and Chairman Kim Jong Un to move forward in terms of inter-Korean reconciliation and cooperation,"" he said. For now, Moon seems to have public backing, with a Gallup Korea survey last week measuring his approval rating at 75 percent. Office worker Kim Jung-eun said the atmosphere of dialogue was welcome after North Korea&aposs provocative run of weapons tests in 2017 pushed animosity to new heights. ""I never truly thought we were headed for another war, but there was always a lingering fear in the back of my head,"" she said. ""Thinking about where we were then, I am really thankful about the current atmosphere of peace. I hope that the process results in lasting peace in the Korean Peninsula."" The Trump-Kim summit has fueled hopes in South Korea that the two leaders may weigh a formal declaration to end the Korean War. The 1950-53 conflict ended with an armistice, but not a formal peace treaty. Some, though, think that such talk should wait. The first priority should be getting North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, said Im Yang-bin, a professor. ""If the issue of denuclearization becomes resolved through talks a declaration ending the war will naturally follow,"" Im said. ___ Associated Press writer Tong-hyung Kim contributed to this report.",https://www.foxnews.com/world/in-south-korea-hope-and-doubt-ahead-of-trump-kim-summit,World,Fox News

         Image 2 of 2 AMIENS, France –  Britain&aposs Prince William and Prime Minister Theresa May, joined by ministers and ambassadors from Allied countries and a former German president, marked on Wednesday the centenary of the Battle of Amiens — a short, bloody and decisive confrontation in northern France that heralded the end of World War I. Chilling readings by May and others recounted the Allied offensive in the eyes of those who fought, including a private, a tank captain, a commander present in the pre-dawn hours of Aug. 8, 1918 for the opening salvos of the combined air and ground assault by soldiers from Britain, Australia, Canada, the United States and France. They quickly began to push back German troops to turn the tide on the Western Front. Each country was represented at the commemoration of the battle that is widely seen as a turning point, leading to the four-month-long Hundred Days Offensive, a string of battlefield successes that led to the Allied victory consecrated three months later by the Nov. 11 Armistice. Also present was former German President Joachim Gauck. Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, addressing the gathering, hailed ""the cooperation without which victory was impossible."" ""It is entirely fitting, therefore, that today that same international coalition has returned to Amiens with our former enemy, in peace and partnership,"" he said. A British youth choir took part in the moving ceremony under the towering columns of the vast 13th century Amiens Cathedral, which was sandbagged at the time to protect it during a series of battles in the northern Picardy region. The emblematic cathedral now contains a Chapel of the Allies. William and May lingered after the nearly 90-minute ceremony to talk with people in attendance, apparently descendants of soldiers who fought in the Battle of Amiens, as they were scheduled to do. The Battle of Amiens saw tens of thousands of soldiers pour into the region, more than 1,900 French and British aircraft and more than 500 tanks from Britain&aposs Tank Corps. The momentum from the first day of battle continued and convinced the Germans that the war was unwinnable. ""The effect of the war was moral and not territorial,"" May, in her reading, quoted then-British Prime Minister David Lloyd George as writing.

She’s a woman who enjoys an A rating from the National Rifle Association and brags about going out to shoot the family turkey for Thanksgiving. She has spoken out in favor of federal fines for sanctuary cities, supported making English the national language, called for more border enforcement and opposed driver’s licenses for illegal immigrants. She is a fiscal moderate and a proud face of rural America. Ohio? Pennsylvania? Wisconsin? She’d romp in all of them. Unfortunately for her party, this woman no longer exists. She is Kirsten Gillibrand circa 2008, the days when she was a congresswoman representing New York’s largely rural 20th district. The 2018 Gillibrand has renounced all of these stances, moving left and left and left again. She supports the New New Deal that is today’s progressive economics (Medicare for all, a federal jobs guarantee, a $15 minimum wage) and says she “couldn’t have been more wrong” about her previous support for gun rights. By 2010, her first full year in the Senate, the NRA had altered its rating of her record — to an F. A decade ago Gillibrand was a strong supporter of Israel; these days she is writing hymns of praise in Time magazine for the far-left anti-Semitic activist Linda Sarsour.

The battle over unions collecting money from non-members moved from the Supreme Court to the court of public employees&apos opinion. On the same day the court announced its ruling in the Janus case barring public-sector unions from automatically collecting fees from government workers who choose not to join the union, libertarian groups were outside government buildings passing out literature. “We’re planning an all-of-the-above comprehensive educational campaign to reach those public employees and let them know about their constitutional rights,” said Maxford Nelsen from the Freedom Foundation, a libertarian think tank based in Washington State. Nelsen has been down this road before. The Freedom Foundation won a smaller but similar ruling in state court four years ago. Since then, his group has been trying to spread the word, but the unions have blocked access to personal contact information. Some of the affected state workers still have not been notified. Greg Devereux, executive director of the Washington Federation of State Employees (WFSE), said his members want their personal information blocked. SUPREME COURT&aposS JANUS DECISION COULD HURT UNIONS&apos POLITICAL MIGHT IN MIDTERMS “Freedom Foundation cares about one thing, and that’s the power of collective voice of people,” said Devereux, “They don’t like that. That’s why they’re trying to destroy us.” According to unionstats.com, most of the fallout from the SCOTUS ruling will be in the Northeast and along the West Coast where there are no right-to-work laws. While nationally just one-third of government workers belong to unions, the penetration is much higher in blue coastal states. In New York, 71 percent of public-sector employees pay union dues, followed closely by Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Maine, California and Washington State. Organized labor held rallies last week blasting the court ruling and vowing to only get stronger. “This was one of the dumbest things they could possibly do. It will energize unions in this country and you will see a resurgence,” said Devereux. Unions are also waging an information campaign selling members on the value of staying in the union and paying those dues and fees. Stephen Baker, who is a state health worker and belongs to WFSE, needs no convincing. SUPREME COURT RULING IN JANUS UNION CASE SPARKS REACTIONS FROM TRUMP, OTHER LAWMAKERS “Those people who say they have no voice, the union is the bulwark,” Baker said, “it is the foundation of democracy in this country.” But Paul Vilja disagrees. He’s a registered nurse working at Western State Hospital and a 29-year member of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU). He’s also a lifelong Republican who says the union’s political contributions do not reflect his values. “I have a voice, and they have to win me back, and they’re welcome to win me back if they’re going to be bipartisan,” Vilja said. Union leaders contend their political activism is all geared toward getting union workers better pay and job protections. But one party gets the lion&aposs share. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, in the 2016 election cycle, public-sector unions spent $64.6 million on campaigns. Ninety percent went to Democrats. The Freedom Foundation said that cash cow for liberal activists is now over. “Allowing unions that ability to compel people to pay them gives them an undue influence, an inflated voice, if you will,” Nelsen said, “because you’re taking these people along for the ride that don’t support the union’s agenda.”",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/supreme-courts-janus-ruling-will-end-cash-cow-for-liberal-activists-experts,Supreme Court,Fox News

The interviewer asked what she found appealing about the show as opposed to other HBO originals like “Game of Thrones,” “Barry” and “Last Week Tonight with John Oliver.” “Is it The Rock?” “Oh yes!” she said, “It is The Rock.” It didn’t take long before the man himself  chimed in  to thank Warren for her support of the show, which is about to enter its fourth season. “I appreciate the love Senator Warren. Enjoy our new season tonight and you have a big Rock sized hug coming when I see ya,” the star tweeted. It turns out that this isn’t the first time that the duo have exchanged thoughts on the show via social media. “To all the reporters tweeting at me about the season premiere of @BallersHBO on Sunday night at 10 pm ET like I haven’t had this date saved on my calendar for months: I KNOW,”  she previously wrote . “You reporters better put some respek on Senator Warren’s name - she is READY for our season premiere of @BallersHBO tomorrow night at 10pm on @HBO.

This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report with Bret Baier,"" June 22, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We are gathered today to hear directly from the American victims of illegal immigration. They are not separated for a day or two days. These are permanently separated. These are the families the media ignores.  As a result of sanctuary city policies in fiscal 2017, more than 8,000 criminal aliens were released back into our civilian population. We don&apost want people in our country that that don&apost go through a process. We want people in our country based on merit.  (END VIDEO CLIP) BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: President Trump today talking about immigration, immigration reform, protecting cities, protecting the country with the border security, tweeting out, however, raising some high brows, ""Republicans should stop wasting their time on immigration until after we elect more senators and congressmen/women in November. Dems are just playing games, have no intention of doing anything to solve this decades old problem. We can pass great legislation after the red wave,"" referring to the election in the fall.  Let&aposs bring in our panel: Byron York, chief political correspondent for The Washington Examiner; Fred Barnes, executive editor of The Weekly Standard; Mara Liasson, national political correspondent for National Public Radio, and Mort Kondracke, contributor for Real Clear Politics. Mort, welcome back.  MORT KONDRACKE, REAL CLEAR POLITICS: Hi.  BAIER: Start with you. What about this immigration stance and whether Congress is moving or not moving or what the president is doing in this process.  KONDRACKE: Look, from the get go Trump has been demonizing Mexicans as rapists and murderer. He ran on xenophobia, he won on xenophobe. He could have had a deal with Chuck Schumer last year. He would have gotten his wall. The DACA kids would have been legalized. He probably now should add we won&apost separate families any more but we will put ankle bracelets on people that we want to keep from melting into the population. He blew up the last deal by insisting that legal immigration be cut in half, even though we need immigrants to pay for Social Security and do jobs that Americans won&apost do. And now he is blowing up whatever chance there was for a House deal, which Paul Ryan should have tried to make a bipartisan bill. But now Trump says you are wasting your time. He said at one point I like both the Goodlatte bill and the compromise bill. Now he says I want no bill. So I think he just --  BAIER: Fred, what about this and how it plays for the midterm and how perhaps the president thinks it plays?  FRED BARNES, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: Well, he doesn&apost think it&aposs playing very well. Obviously, you know those tweets where he said we&aposre going to have to go back to the midterm election, or go forward to it, and then we can have a red wave and then we can do something. He is basically right about that. He recognizes he is in a fix. Is he not going to get anything passed. The Democrats don&apost want to pass anything. The Republicans don&apost have the votes. And he has no great influence on this issue in Congress.  So I think it&aposs going to get worse for Trump. We&aposre going to start seeing the thing Republicans hate the most, and that&aposs catch and release, because some of these children will be getting released after 20 days, and they can&apost be allowed to wander around out there, so you have to let the parents out and tell them they can come back for a hearing. Of course, they never come back.  BAIER: Yes, Byron.  BRYON YORK, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: This is more proof of Republican dysfunction on this issue. They have had trouble with this issue for a very long time. These bills contain the president&aposs number one campaign promise, his number one priority on this which is the construction of a border wall. It takes 215 votes to pass this bill right now. There are 235 Republicans in the House. Does anybody believe there are going to be more Republicans in the house after November. Regardless what the president says about a red wave, they have a chance to pass a bill that would fund the president&aposs top priority, that would fix the DACA problem and would address today&aposs current problem of family separations. And yet they are not able to get this together.  BAIER: Do you take a half a loaf in other words? Take a listen to the reaction to the tweet from lawmakers up on the Hill:  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think the president is expressing his frustration that Democrats don&apost want to solve the problem while we do.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We shouldn&apost do anything legislatively until we can reconnect these children. That has to be our highest priority right now.  REP. LOUIE GOHMERT, R-TEXAS: I think the president did the right thing. I appreciated his tweet today more than you can imagine.  REP. JIM JORDAN, R-OHIO: The president is right. Chuck Schumer said this earlier in the week. They don&apost want to do anything. But at least the House should show the American people we are doing what we said.  (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Mara?  MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: Yes, see, that&aposs the problem. Even if everyone knows you can&apost pass something through the Senate because it as president keeps on pointing out you need democrat votes there, moderate house Republicans were desperate for a chance to just vote on something just because they are in competitive districts. They want to show their voters they tried to solve the Dreamer problem. They tried to end family separations. But the president pulled out the rug from out from under them and said we shouldn&apost even bother. Don&apost waste your time.  Just a couple days ago he said I&aposm with you 1,000 percent. I&aposm behind these bills. So a lot of confusion not just on the policy, not just what&aposs going to happen to these kids on the border, but also what&aposs going to happen on Capitol Hill. This is an issue that up until now has been a pretty good one for him. It energizes his base. It goes back to some really core issues that he has used all along. It helped him win the White House. But now I think he has muddied the water so much it&aposs hard to know what he wants.  BAIER: As you look, Mort, let me just put up the generic Congressional ballot as it stands now, Democrat 46.3, Republicans 40.2. That&aposs the average of the recent polls. It has closed down in recent days. It&aposs tough to see how this all plays, isn&apost it, by the time you get to the fall?  KONDRACKE: Yes. I have no idea how these elections are going to turn out. I think they are going to be all about Trump and his character and so on.  But look, if he really wanted a bill, he could put the Democrats to a test. Put a decent bill on the table, stick to it. Tell Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan I want this bill. And let the Democrats blow it up and prove him right. My guess is that if it was a decent enough bill, he could get a lot more than even the wall. He could probably get an end to the visa lottery and he could get a gradual change from family reunification to talent as the basis. I think he is basically a xenophobe. He rode it to the White House. Now he has got all these European pals of his who are xenophobes and I think he is going to ride this wave forever.  BAIER: All right, second half of the beltway boys. Wrap it up here.  BARNES: Look, this is an issue that Democrats have finally found a part of the issue that helps them, and that&aposs this whole issue of separation of children from their families. It&aposs about the only one that&aposs been around that Democrats could really use. Trump is going to use not this particular part of the issue, but the whole immigration issue this fall in the midterm, and I think it will help him.

38,2018-08-14 00:00:00,2018,8.0,14,Robert Charles,Here's how Trump can end the whole Mueller investigation farce,"close Video Swamp Watch: James Comey and Robert Mueller Mueller and Comey are model public servants, we're told. Special Counsel Robert Mueller seems determined to press forward with some version of the Spanish Inquisition – an increasingly indefensible, apparently groundless, objectively debilitating inquiry into what was initially one question: Did the Trump campaign knowingly coordinate with Russia to win the 2016 presidential election? Barring something that has remained hidden for more than 20 months, Americans know the facts: Mueller’s inquisition was triggered by several Obama-Clinton partisans, including anti-Trump appointees at the FBI and CIA. The names of these partisans now trigger nausea: Fired FBI Director James Comey; former CIA Director John Brennan; former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper; fired FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe; disgraced FBI Agent Peter Strzok (whose firing was announced Monday); former FBI lawyer Lisa Page (who was carrying on an extramarital affair with Strzok); and several others. Even the story line is now nauseating. Comey, despite holding clearances as head of the FBI, contradicted himself before Congress, leaked documents through a secret cutout, proudly triggered Mueller’s appointment, and then cashed in with a big-money book. Brennan traded his role as intelligence briefer in President Clinton’s White House for political gain in President Obama’s. When he ran the CIA he fed partisan anti-Trump information to the FBI, possibly circumventing U.S. laws by procuring foreign involvement. By some reports, he may have even sought to legally block Trump’s inauguration. This increasingly baseless, meandering, delegitimized inquisition is not only distracting, discouraging and a dangerous drag on democracy – exactly what Russia, China and Iran want – but it does no one any good.  Clapper, already famous for misleading Congress under oath, became another vocal anti-Trump detractor. Then Andrew McCabe, No. 2 at the FBI under Comey, turned out to be a subterranean anti-Trump partisan, who was reproached by the Justice Department’s inspector general for breach of integrity. And as for Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, despite FBI employment and centrality to an “investigation” clearing Hillary Clinton, both were prolific anti-Trump texting partners and made it clear that they did not want to see him become president. The saga rivals a Shakespearean tragedy, and has frankly made average Americans disgusted. It now threatens to darken America’s midterm elections – exactly what the Russians have wanted, we know now. So I have a recommendation for ending the tragedy before our country is consumed by this third-rate play, an ever-widening, seemingly unlimited inquiry into everything and anything that could possibly justify more authority, taxpayer dollars, distraction, time and the civil disruption. After all, that is what baseless inquisitions always do. This recommendation may save the nation from more mutual recrimination and civil unrest. Clearly, Mueller wants to build a case for impeachment, despite every indication that there is no evidence to support the cause. He wants to compel an incriminating presidential deposition, trap President Trump into a contradiction to warrant obstruction of justice charges, and use that as a pretext to help partisan Democrats in Congress lead a fight to impeach the president. It seems that Mueller wants to turn his team into heroes of the left – like Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein of Watergate fame – by bringing down a Republican president. Who knows, maybe Mueller envisions an aging Robert Redford (who played Woodward in the film “All the President’s Men” in 1976) coming out of his recently-announced retirement to play him on the silver screen. It’s time to bring this drama – or perhaps we should call it a farce – to a close. To end this inquiry, President Trump may need to step up, and not on Twitter. That’s because the Mueller probe is down to a game of chicken over whether to subpoena the president’s personal testimony – a risky course both for the president and for Mueller’s team. If President Trump resists an open-ended deposition and Mueller seeks one by subpoena anyway, Mueller could lose at the Supreme Court. This would probably force the winding down of the special counsel’s unruly inquisition, and possibly tip public sentiment toward the president. However, if Mueller gambles on the subpoena and wins, everything goes the other way. The president is forced to testify with fewer limitations, Mueller is re-empowered, public opinion tips against the president. Notably, the average American loses in both eventualities. If Mueller wins, we can expect a grueling deposition, more tricks and traps – and a messy, drawn out and ultimately useless impeachment confrontation. If President Trump wins at the Supreme Court, Mueller’s inquisition is dealt a blow, but with no incentive for closure or resolution, just stalemate. Mueller’s resentment could rise and the inquiry could go on even longer. There is a third way. If it is to work, it needs to happen now, without delay. President Trump could offer a credible, workable compromise – perhaps some sworn answers to written questions and an interview on limited topics. To wait until the subpoena is issued is a dead end. President Nixon tried that, and failed miserably. Yes, circumstances were different, but the gamble becomes a debilitating distraction – and ends any chance of compromise. After U.S. District Judge John Sirica upheld the subpoena of tapes that President Nixon secretly recorded of his Oval Office conversations – and the Supreme Court sided with Sirica – Nixon tried to compromise. He offered transcripts, verified by a Democratic senator. That might have worked before the subpoena, but the offer came too late. Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox had won on the tapes subpoena, so Nixon’s compromise was useless. Cox declined the compromise and Nixon fired him in the “Saturday Night Massacre.” The rest is history. Confronting impeachment, Nixon resigned and was also nearly indicted, until President Ford pardoned him. What is the lesson from this page out of the history books? For Mueller and President Trump: Do not put our nation through any more of this inquisition mess, even if Republicans continue to control Congress, even if the Supreme Court is likely to side with the president on personal testimony, even if both sides think they could win. This increasingly baseless, meandering, delegitimized inquisition is not only distracting, discouraging and a dangerous drag on democracy – exactly what Russia, China and Iran want – but it does no one any good. Let’s find a way to end it, consistent with rule of law. To get to that end state, President Trump may need to compromise and so will Mueller. That outcome would be best for America. This is not medieval Spain circa 1478, but modern America 2018.

41,2018-09-27 00:00:00,2018,9.0,27,Miranda Green,EPA to merge two key science offices and disband office focused on science grants | TheHill,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will merge two key science offices as part of an overhaul of the Office of Research Development (ORD), the EPA confirmed to The Hill Thursday. ORD leadership announced to staff Wednesday that it will move forward with plans to reorganize multiple offices housed under ORD, the scientific research arm of EPA. Offices with “similar functions” will be funneled into two new offices: the administrative focused Office of Resource Management and the science focused Office of Science Integration and Policy, an EPA spokesperson told the Hill. The new science office will combine the agency’s Office of Science Policy and the Office of the Science Advisor into one, which environmentalists fear will shrink the voice of scientists at EPA. The EPA official said the mergers will “reduce redundancies in our operations, streamline management oversight, and better align our structure with the resources we have.” The Office of the Science Advisor, as described on EPA's website, provides leadership across the agency on science policy development and implementation issues It is currently lead by EPA Science Advisor Jennifer Orme-Zavaleta, who has been at EPA since 1981. The Office of Science Policy focuses on incorporating ORD's own science and technology into the EPA's regulatory actions. It's headed by Fred Hauchman, who has worked at EPA for over 30 years. An ORD spokesperson said Orme-Zavaleta was out of town and not available for comment Thursday. A voicemail box for Hauchman said he'd be out of town until October 1 and to contact the directory in his absence. Additionally, the reorganization would disband the National Center for Environmental Research (NCER), a federal environmental office that works to test the effects of chemical exposure on adults and children. The NCER is largely known for the funding it provides through its premier program, Science To Achieve Results (STAR). Under the STAR program, grants are given to the Children's Environmental Health and Disease Prevention Research Centers, which were established in 1988 to discover methods to reduce children's health risks from environmental factors. Under the reorganization, “relevant functions” of NCER will be distributed among the two new offices including the STAR grants management, the official said. The Hill was first to report on the planned reorganization in February. Officials at the time said the reorganization would also include merging EPA’s Office of Administrative and Research Support, the Office of Program Accountability and Resource Management, and the office that handles Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. Michael Halpern, a deputy director of the Union of Concerned Scientists called the changes within the science offices alarming. “Any time you try to merge science and policy functions there tends to be confusion. That’s why a lot of the laws EPA implements like the Clean Air Act have separate sections for the science and the policy,” he said. “Muddying the waters makes it much easier for the science to be politicized or misrepresented.” Halpern surmised that the new rearrangement will likely bury the office farther down the totem pole from the EPA Administrator's office. ""We’ve seen what happens when an office gets de-prioritized, they become less visible. The office of environmental justice, which is a shell of what it was before, the Office of Children Health Protection would be equally vulnerable. It's the more cross cutting programs that tend to be the most vulnerable to politicization,"" he said. Earlier in the week the EPA reportedly placed the director of its Office of Children’s Health Protection Director Dr. Ruth Etzel on administrative leave without explanation. Etzel told reporters she believed the move was done to ultimately shrink the office, an accusation EPA officials denied to The Hill. EPA did not respond to requests about who will be leading the new offices or when the merger will officially commence but said there would be no reductions of full time staff as a result of the changes.  View the discussion thread.

Raju asked.  McConnell responded by celebrating his wife's story, noting that she came to the U.S. at ""age 8, legally, not speaking a word of English."" He added that Chao ""has realized the American dream, and I think all of us think that this is a process of renewal that’s gone on in this country for a very long time, and it’s good for America and we ought to continue it.""

43,2019-03-11 00:00:00,2019,3.0,11,"Harris Faulkner, opinion contributor",DNC decision to shut out Fox News hurts Democratic candidates and Americans | TheHill,"I had just arrived in Bettendorf, Iowa, for a speech to Women Lead Change. Suddenly, it became a very important speech: A nice woman was introducing me as a Fox News anchor who had moderated a town hall on immigration in Arizona, the only network journalist to sit down with the Democratic and Republican candidates for Senate ahead of the midterms — all as news broke that Democratic National Committee chairman Tom PerezThomas Edward PerezClinton’s top five vice presidential picks Government social programs: Triumph of hope over evidence Labor’s 'wasteful spending and mismanagement” at Workers’ Comp MORE had stripped Fox News of any chance to host his party’s presidential primary debates. An entire network of journalists was being thwarted from the political process. And my 25-year commitment to open, fair debate, which I moderate across two shows on Fox News, was being cast in doubt. I’m issuing a call to action from others in the media — just like when Fox News insisted that all journalists with press credentials be included at White House press briefings, after CNN reporter Jim Acosta was tossed out for displeasing President TrumpDonald John TrumpFacebook releases audit on conservative bias claims Harry Reid: 'Decriminalizing border crossings is not something that should be at the top of the list' Recessions happen when presidents overlook key problems MORE, or when we publicly backed White House correspondent Kaitlin Collins when she was shut out of an open press event in the Rose Garden. The very network that Chairman Perez is skewering now, came to the defense of our colleagues at CNN. My father, a Vietnam War pilot, used to tell me that the only really bad decisions are the ones you stick to even when you get facts that support a change in the mission. Lt. Col. Bobby Harris recalled our heroes getting shot at because making a course correction was sometimes rejected out of ego. I wrote about those wartime lessons in my 2018 book, “9 Rules of Engagement: A Military Brat’s Guide to Life and Success.” I want to focus on one of those rules, Rule No. 1: Recruit your special forces. That means, choose people you trust to help you achieve victory. Maybe that’s what Mr. Perez is doing, by choosing networks whose opinion hosts lean left. But I’d further posit that those candidates on the left need to decide if his decision helps them win and whether he truly has their backs. When Chairman Perez announced last week, “I believe that the key pathway to victory is to continue to expand our electorate and reach all voters,” it was indeed a noble mission. That’s exactly why I invite and interview so many Democrats on my show — because I want to expand the audience and reach everyone with good, spirited debate. Yet, that was not Chairman Perez’s true mission. He then announced: “Fox News will not serve as a media partner for the 2020 Democratic primary debates.” Mr. Perez is promising Democrats a giant viewership solely via our competitors. In fact, our competitors don’t consistently have the biggest audiences to reach all voters. And while they have talented journalists, just like we do, they also have an opinion team: We have Hannity, they have Maddow. Most newspapers have this dual approach to disseminating news and opinion, too — a front page with hard news headlines, and an editorial section. In reality, Perez is standing between the Democratic candidates and Fox News’ dizzying reach, across what looks like 12 primary debates. Here are some numbers to consider: In 2016, an average of 2.6 million people watched Fox News’ first Democratic town hall of that presidential election cycle. My colleague Bret Baier hosted that evening with Democratic frontrunner Hillary ClintonHillary Diane Rodham ClintonThe exhaustion of Democrats' anti-Trump delusions Poll: Trump trails three Democrats by 10 points in Colorado Soft levels of support mark this year's Democratic primary MORE and Sen. Bernie SandersBernie SandersHarry Reid: 'Decriminalizing border crossings is not something that should be at the top of the list' The exhaustion of Democrats' anti-Trump delusions Warren offers plan to repeal 1994 crime law authored by Biden MORE (I-Vt.). That town hall had more viewers than CNN (877K) and MSNBC (555K) combined in the hour. Why wouldn’t the DNC want to have it all? Fox News, CNN, MSNBC … everybody should want to sit with every outlet that can spotlight their reason for wanting to lead this great nation. It’s happened before on a smaller scale. The RNC pulled out of an NBC News debate when former chairman Reince PriebusReinhold (Reince) Richard PriebusTrump blasts Scaramucci as 'incapable' Trump taps Sean Spicer to join Naval Academy board of visitors  Trump's no racist — he's an equal opportunity offender MORE thought the CNBC hosts (not under the news division, I might add) reportedly had a poor, unfair, partisan showing with Republican candidates on Oct. 28, 2015. That was just one debate. With Perez, we are talking an entire election season barring Fox News. All the while, his party’s candidates are trying to pull off a historically uncommon defeat of an incumbent president. So, Perez’s idea to grow the DNC’s reach is to make sure the men and women running for president won’t be seen on a network with raptor-like force and reach in the jungle of politics. Do you think that limits voters’ access to the Democratic candidates? And about journalism and the Constitution: Is DNC Chairman Perez engaging in any form of stifling the press? I have this same issue with President Trump, who persists on calling members of the media the “enemies of the people.” He’s wrong, and so is Perez.  As I write this, there are only two reports of Democratic candidates speaking up about missing out on a huge stage with people who might vote in ways we cannot fully predict — Rep. John DelaneyJohn Kevin DelaneyDelaney shakes up top campaign staff Poll: Nearly 4 in 5 say they will consider candidates' stances on cybersecurity Native American advocates question 2020 Democrats' commitment MORE (D-Md.) and Sen. Kirsten GillibrandKirsten Elizabeth GillibrandCastro qualifies for next Democratic primary debates The Hill's Morning Report - Trump searches for backstops amid recession worries 2020 Democrats react to NYPD firing of officer in Garner case: 'Finally' MORE (D-N.Y.). Perhaps they understand that journalists would be moderating our debates, as it’s been at Fox News since its inception. I’ve interviewed nearly half of Congress, bipartisan every step of the way. We debate fiercely at times over the facts but always end with a warm welcome to return to Fox News. This is true diversity — and I don’t just mean me being the only black female anchor with a show Monday thru Friday. I mean diversity of perspective, thought and approach. Dozens of Democrats appear on Fox News each month. If it were not worth their time and energy to debate, converse and display their experience and governing styles to millions of voters who happen to watch Fox News, wouldn’t they all just line up at others’ broadcast booths on Capitol Hill? Mr. Perez’s fellow Democrats seem to acknowledge what I know for sure: Americans are shrewd, hopeful, educated and busy. They want to feel confident that every voice is weighing in when and where they tune in. That’s the premise of what Bret Baier, Martha MacCallum, Chris Wallace, me and many others on Fox News put into motion on our news hours, and especially in our debates. Candidates seeking the highest office in our government deserve the opportunity to be fully heard. I would say to Chairman Perez: You apparently have little faith in Democratic candidates’ abilities to answer tough questions before voters of all viewpoints. You hurl disrespect at the process of a free press hosting debates to allow Americans every opportunity to make an informed decision. Further, you apparently don’t trust that expanded electorate, of which you spoke, to make informed decisions. It is well documented that Fox News has the audience demographics that other networks thirst for. Don’t they deserve to see every candidate step on the biggest stage with award-winning journalists? Perez’s decision is damaging to the process, the voters and his own candidates — especially considering how many people identify as political independents. I’m hoping he will sharpen his awareness and change course to be more inclusive.

The host noted that it's not clear where Trump gathered that figure, but that the Justice Department said that Mueller's expenses were around $12 million by September 2018.  ""The final price tag will no doubt be higher than that, but the data's not public. Where he got $35 million, no idea,"" Tapper said. He then targeted the claim that the investigation was led by ""18 angry Democrats,"" noting that Mueller hired 19 lawyers and that Mueller himself is a ""well-known Republican,"" as well as former Deputy Attorney General Rod RosensteinRod RosensteinWhy the presumption of innocence doesn't apply to Trump McCabe sues FBI, DOJ, blames Trump for his firing Rosenstein: Trump should focus on preventing people from 'becoming violent white supremacists' MORE. Rosenstein appointed Mueller and oversaw the investigation. Tapper acknowledges that Trump is correct about length of the investigation, the amount of subpoenas issued and the number of witnesses involved.  But he takes issue with the poster's inclusion of the statements, ""No Collusion"" and ""No Obstruction."" Tapper notes that while Mueller did not find sufficient evidence to conclude a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Moscow took place, it did identify numerous links between the two.  ""Mueller specifically said that collusion was not a legal term and the report was not going to address it all,"" Tapper said, going on to note that Mueller made no conclusive determination regarding obstruction of justice.   ""And if you read the report, Mueller in detail describes at least 10 instances which may have constituted obstruction. And Mueller clearly leaves it up to Congress to proceed,"" he said.  ""There was a time in the Trump administration when his people would try to either explain his falsehoods as somehow in the neighborhood of something possibly accurate, or they would just change the subject,"" Tapper continues. ""But there has been a long slow slide into just taking his lies and asserting them to you. You are paying for those lies."" Trump has continually railed against Mueller's probe, and on Wednesday used a placard describing facts from it to complement his criticism. The placard stood in front of Trump as he threatened to block infrastructure talks until Democrats' investigations into him finished.   View the discussion thread.

Trump spent most of the day near the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas, a visit many in Washington see as a precursor to an emergency declaration after talks with congressional leaders imploded the day before.  ""Well, we can declare a national emergency. We shouldn't have to because this is just common sense,"" Trump told reporters on the banks of the Rio Grande River, flanked by border agents and piles of plastic-wrapped drugs seized at the frontier. But if talks don't pick back up, Trump said, ""then you will see what happens with national emergency, which I can do very easily and there's no question it holds up.""   What about the money? The White House is looking at $13.9 billion in funding approved by Congress last year as part of a disaster response bill to use for building Trump's wall in the event he declares an emergency. That bill provided funding for various Army Corps of Engineers projects that has been allocated but not spent.  ""I can tell you that's definitely an option that has been presented to the president. Nothing has been finalized yet though,"" said an administration official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Another administration official confirmed that option is under consideration, but said other plans are also being discussed. The Hill's Jordan Fabian has the story.   Talks fall apart: Trump's declaration came a day after a brief but explosive White House meeting with Democratic leaders. The president stormed out of a negotiation session with House Speaker Nancy PelosiNancy PelosiJohnson eyes Irish border in Brexit negotiations Mueller report fades from political conversation Five key players in Trump's trade battles MORE (D-Calif.) and Charles SchumerCharles (Chuck) Ellis SchumerJohnson eyes Irish border in Brexit negotiations Lewandowski on potential NH Senate run: If I run, 'I'm going to win' Appropriators warn White House against clawing back foreign aid MORE (D-N.Y.) after Pelosi rebuffed his request for border wall funding once the shutdown concluded.   The latest from the House: Lawmakers Thursday attempted to pave the way to reopening the government after 20 days of a partial shutdown.   But those bills are headed for a buzzsaw in the Senate: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnellAddison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellPelosi, Schumer press for gun screenings as Trump inches away The malware election: Returning to paper ballots only way to prevent hacking First House Republican backs bill banning assault weapons MORE (R-Ky.) on Thursday blocked two House-passed funding bills that would reopen the federal government.   Immigration talks falter: Broader immigration reform talks also collapsed in the Senate after a last-ditch effort by a group of Senate Republicans to end the partial government shutdown quickly unraveled on Thursday. After fruitless talks between Trump and congressional leadership, the moderate group was viewed as a last-ditch effort to find a negotiated solution that would avoid an emergency declaration by Trump to build the wall. ""I think we're stuck. I just don't see a pathway forward,"" Sen. Lindsey GrahamLindsey Olin GrahamTwo-thirds of Republicans support 'red flag' gun laws: NPR poll Red flag laws won't stop mass shootings — ending gun-free zones will Pelosi warns Mnuchin to stop 'illegal' .3B cut to foreign aid MORE (R-S.C.) told reporters. ""I don't know who to talk to and I don't know what else to do."" Graham later called on Trump to build the wall through an emergency declaration, adding ""I hope it works.""   Trump promises to pay federal workers after shutdown: President Trump has promised Democratic Sen.

The Senate passed by unanimous consent legislation Thursday evening providing that federal workers -- essential and furloughed employees -- will be paid once the shutdown is over. Federal employees are due to miss paychecks Friday, which has caused consternation in the Washington, DC, region. Trump made his pledge in a phone call with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) as part of an effort to work out a deal to adjourn the Senate this week. The Hill's Alexander Bolton has more.   Fallout from the shutdown:   LEADING THE DAY Fed chief Powell: Prolonged shutdown will harm US economy: Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Thursday that the partial government shutdown could hinder the U.S. economy and the central bank's ability to keep it stable. Powell said at the Economic Club of Washington, D.C., that a prolonged shutdown may harm the world's largest economy beyond the financial hardship facing hundreds of thousands of furloughed and ""essential"" federal workers who are expected to go without a paycheck this week. The Fed chief said that while shutdowns ""typically don't last very long,"" an extended shutdown ""would show up in the data pretty clearly.""   Powell said it's difficult to gauge the full economic impact of the shutdown since one of the central bank's major sources of data, the Commerce Department, is shuttered.   China sees progress on 'structural issues' in trade talks with US: The U.S. and Beijing made progress on ""structural issues"" during talks to resolve a trade dispute between the two countries, China's commerce ministry said on Thursday, according to Reuters. Ministry spokesman Gao Feng reportedly said during a news conference that the two sides made progress on issues including forced technology transfers, intellectual property, tariff barriers and cyber attacks. Gao added that the talks between the two countries were ""serious"" and ""honest,"" the news service reported.   GOOD TO KNOW   ODDS AND ENDS View the discussion thread.

47,2019-11-15 00:00:00,2019,11.0,15,"Daniel F. Runde, opinion contributor",Countering malign Kremlin influence will be with us for decades | TheHill,"Since the dissolution of the Eastern Bloc in 1991, the U.S. has been a trusted partner to Central and Eastern European nations. During the 1990s, this engagement focused on helping countries transition to democracy and developing the private sector and free markets. There was incredible economic and social progress in the Baltics, Poland, the Czech Republic and elsewhere. In other countries, the progress was slower. Russia, which dominated the Eastern Bloc since 1945, was preoccupied with its own challenges. However, for the last 15 years, Russia has been resurgent and has sought to cobble together a new Soviet Union or something akin to it. Russia’s leadership has emerged as a credible threat to democracy and independence in its neighborhood. Russia’s people are not the problem, but the political leadership led by Vladimir PutinVladimir Vladimirovich PutinAs Buttigieg rises, Biden is still the target Yang jokes first thing he'd say to Putin as president is 'Sorry I beat your guy' Biden: Impeachment hearings show 'Trump doesn't want me to be the nominee' MORE and his small coterie of oligarchs is. Curtailing access to energy, spreading disinformation, targeted political assassinations, cyber-attacks and elections interference have been the new weapons deployed by Russian leadership to bring its neighbors back under its orbit. The Kremlin, led by Putin, wants to enable economic dependence on Russia and also wants to have unstable democracies or friendly autocracies they can manipulate. My colleague, Heather Conley, and others have written about the Kremlin threat through a comprehensive study entitled ""The Kremlin Playbook."" In her series of reports, she describes how Russia cultivates networks in countries with weak democratic institutions and uses them to direct and influence decision-making. These networks concentrate on exploiting state resources to further Russian influence and are a key component of Russia's New Generation Warfare. The Russia threat has forced the United States to rethink its role and strategy for the region. The first step is to understand the nature of the threat; second, to understand what resources the U.S. has in hand that can be deployed and, lastly, to understand what can be done in partnership with our allies. Much of the resources at our disposal are “soft power” (read, ""foreign assistance"") resources. Much of the responsibility for pushing back on what the Trump administration calls “Malign Kremlin Influence” falls on the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) which administers the bulk of American foreign assistance. These efforts have led to the first major reframing of our foreign assistance in that part of the world in at least 10 years. After significant consultations with Republican and Democratic members on the Hill, the Trump administration recently rolled out its “Countering Malign Kremlin Influence” (CMKI) strategy. CMKI has four main objectives: Counter efforts to undermine democratic institutions and the rule of law, resist the manipulation of information, reduce both energy and economic vulnerabilities. USAID has significantly increased spending in these target areas and countries, including an increase in funding to Ukraine from $33.6 million in fiscal year 2014 to $182.3 million in 2018. This new approach is likely going to be the strategy for at least the next 15 years in the region, especially for countries around Russia’s periphery, the so-called “frontline states” such as Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia. (I know USAID well because I used to work there, and I chair an outside advisory board for USAID but have not been engaged in shaping CMKI, nor do I work directly on CMKI related projects.) USAID and others are asking: “How do we encourage these countries to free themselves from Russian energy dependency? How do we strengthen their systems — and ours — from cyber-attacks, bots, and other cyber trickery? How do we significantly reduce these countries’ economic dependency on Russia and towards Europe, Turkey and other markets? How do we enable greater personal and political freedom? How can we strengthen the media and civil society engagement in this region?” One example of the sorts of efforts we are going to see more from USAID can be found in the wine industry of Moldova. Moldovan wine sales to Russia decreased by 30 percent and increased by 16 percent to the United States after Moldova woke up and saw that too much economic dependency on Russia was creating trouble for the country. It exported even more to the Czech Republic, Britain and others. USAID helped Moldova move the wine industry away from Russia and is continuing these efforts as part of the Moldova Economic Growth Project. As part of the project, USAID is helping Moldova meet international wine standards. Another example is energy in Ukraine. For years, efforts in Ukraine focused on energy efficiency issues. This meant providing soft loans to get large buildings to modernize their structures and power supply. What Ukraine actually needs is a total shift away from any energy dependency on Russia. Ukraine’s electric grid is still connected to Russia even after five years of war with its neighbor. However, Ukraine is in the process of moving to connect to Europe’s electric grid which is a hard, complicated process. As part of CMKI, USAID is helping Ukraine transition its power connection from Russia to Central Europe. American foreign aid is transformational and still needed in this region, but it is not going to replace American trade and investment. If the United States is not there, these countries will seek other trading partners, including China or even Russia. The United States should be reviewing our trade relations with the countries around Russia’s periphery and seek to deepen those economic ties. We will still need several critical soft-power tools present in the region including the EXIM Bank and the new U.S. Development Finance Corporation (DFC, formerly known as OPIC) to compete with China, Turkey and the Gulf States. Another overlooked instrument for this fight is ensuring that these countries reach a high-caliber level of English language. If we want these countries to turn away from Russia, we need them to speak and operate in the English language at levels that allow them to integrate into the West. Unfortunately, Ukraine, Albania and Georgia all rank in the ""low"" category on Education First’s English Proficiency Index. CMKI is not only a way to help countries push back against the Russia challenge but also is a way to help enable more integration with the West. According to a recent poll by the Pew Research Center, most people in this region support the shift from one-party rule and a state-controlled economy to a multiparty system and a market economy. Interestingly, on the other hand, more than 60 percent of Russians surveyed characterize the end of the Soviet Union as a great misfortune. Over the next several administrations, CMKI is going to be the significant soft-power approach for this part of the world. Daniel F. Runde is a senior vice president and William A.

48,2018-01-30 00:00:00,2018,1.0,30,Lydia Wheeler,FDA faces new lawsuits over e-cigarette rule | TheHill,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is facing a new wave of legal challenges over its rules for electronic cigarettes. The Pacific Legal Foundation filed lawsuits on behalf of vaping businesses in district courts in the District of Columbia, Minnesota and Texas on Tuesday. In the lawsuits, the foundation argues the FDA’s so-called deeming rule, which brings e-cigarettes under the same regulatory scheme as traditional cigarettes, violates the First Amendment because it allows the agency to treat many nontobacco vaping products as if they were tobacco products regulated by the Tobacco Control Act. “Thanks to the Deeming Rule, anyone who manufactures or sells a vaping product must obtain FDA’s preapproval before engaging in truthful speech concerning that product’s health and related effects,” attorneys for the legal group argue in court documents. “Moreover, it is the would-be speaker who must bear the burden of convincing the agency that the truthful speech will improve public health. Such restrictions on truthful speech are presumed unconstitutional under the First Amendment, and it is the government—not the speaker—which must bear the heavy burden to overcome that presumption. The Deeming Rule unconstitutionally shifts that burden from the government to speakers.” Manufacturers have long claimed e-cigarettes are less harmful and can help people quit smoking.  A report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, however, found that e-cigarettes, while safer than traditional cigarettes and a useful tool for helping people quit smoking, are not necessarily “safe.” The report also found e-cigarettes put teens at a higher risk of trying cigarettes.  The lawsuits also allege the rule is unconstitutional because Leslie Kux, the career FDA employee who issued it, had no authority to do so. “Because the issuance of a rule is final, because a rule binds the government and the regulated public, and because a rule cannot be easily reversed, only a principal officer of the United States—one who has been nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate—may exercise such authority,” the foundation wrote. In July, Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia upheld the FDA’s rule against a challenge from Nicopure Labs LLC. The e-liquids manufacturer had argued that the FDA overstepped its legal authority under the Tobacco Control Act in subjecting e-cigarettes to the same federal laws as traditional cigarettes. “Congress gave the FDA broad authority to deem new products to be ‘tobacco products’ subject to that existing statutory regime, and the Court finds that it was not arbitrary and capricious for the agency to decide to take that action with respect to e-cigarettes,” she wrote in her opinion.

Comey was humiliatingly removed by the president last May and enjoyed a brief period of bipartisan sympathy for the disgraceful manner in which he was dispatched. The FBI’s seventh director learned of his termination via televised news reports while appearing before an FBI audience in Los Angeles. This is not the manner with which career public servants should ever be separated from service. Yet, with the current president, it has become de rigueur. Initially taking the high road, remaining silent, professional and above the fray, Comey has now resorted to directly confronting the president at his own game. He shed his original anonymous Twitter nom de plume, “Reinhold Niebuhr,” and directly waded in to criticize and taunt his tormentor. In the immediate wake of FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabeAndrew George McCabeThe Hill's Morning Report — Will Congress do anything on gun control? McCabe sues FBI, DOJ, blames Trump for his firing McCabe says it's 'absolutely' time to launch impeachment inquiry into Trump MORE’s firing and Trump’s Twitter gloating, Comey ominously warned, “Mr. President, the American people will hear my story very soon. And they can judge for themselves who is honorable and who is not.” And, just like that, Comey conceded the tiny sliver of moral high ground he precariously clung to and reduced his position as an advocate of the pursuit of facts into a narcissistic quest to sell books. He unwittingly joined Trump in the pig-wallow that currently serves as civil discourse. He continues to diminish himself and the cherished office he once held. It didn’t have to be this way. Comey was appointed to be FBI director by former President Obama in September 2013. He was quite unlike his predecessors; he enjoyed a cult of personality that resulted in numerous FBI professional support employees — even some agents — donning “Comey is my Homie” T-shirts after his humiliating firing by Trump last May. The tears shed following his public scourging were real. I was one of the forlorn, feeling in the immediate aftermath that a good man had been done wrong. Yet, recent revelations of his questionable decisionmaking and lack of courage in failing to stand up to Loretta Lynch, Obama’s politicized attorney general, and the current president, have changed the views of many of us who carry (or once carried) the shield and credentials of FBI special agents. We base this assessment on a number of impossible-to-defend actions and inactions by Comey. Former U.S. Attorney Joseph diGenova, laid out a strong case that Comey contributed to the disgraceful politicization of the FBI — which, in part, led to his dismissal — via stupefying decisions in the Clinton emails and Trump-Russia collusion cases. The former chief prosecutor’s adapted remarks, delivered in a speech in January at Hillsdale College’s Allan P. Kirby Jr. Center for Constitutional Studies and Citizenship, can be found in the February 28 edition of Imprimis in a piece titled, ""The Politicization of the FBI."" Comey is certainly viewed as a polarizing figure by many Americans. Part of what makes him such an enigma to those of us who served under him was that he could appear so courageous and, yet, so self-admittedly cowardly.  His speech at Georgetown University in February 2015, “Hard Truths: Law Enforcement and Race,” was an unprecedented acknowledgement by an FBI director that, at times, people of color don’t receive equal treatment under the law. It was a seminal moment in the lagging effort to achieve a police partnership with inner-city communities by honestly engaging and speaking truth to power. It was a brave speech — in my estimation, the high-water mark of his directorship. But the sober, courageous director who gave those remarks exited the stage long ago, replaced by a character on Twitter. Emboldened by the left’s new adoption of him as a victim/messiah, he has shed any pretense of professional stoicism and seemingly cares little that self-indulgently discussing his interactions with the president now, before the probe concludes, may deleteriously alter the outcome. Then again, recall his less-than-honorable leaking of his memos, through a surrogate, to The New York Times. His explanation, that he hoped it would trigger the appointment of a special prosecutor, was a clear abdication of responsibility. His nine encounters with the president left him admittedly “uneasy.” And, as he shamefully recounted to Sen. Dianne FeinsteinDianne Emiel FeinsteinTrump administration urges Congress to reauthorize NSA surveillance program The Hill's Morning Report - More talk on guns; many questions on Epstein's death Juan Williams: We need a backlash against Big Tech MORE (D-Calif.) during a Senate Intelligence Committee Hearing last June, “maybe other people would be stronger in that circumstance but that — that was — that’s how I conducted myself.” In failing to challenge the president, one only needs to recall Comey’s failure to also push back on the aforementioned Lynch, in order to establish a sad pattern of behavior. Lynch added to the undeniable politicization of the Department of Justice by outrageously suggesting that the FBI refer to the Clinton investigation as a “matter.” This was language repeatedly utilized by the Clinton campaign to dismiss a federal investigation as “much ado about nothing.” Comey testified that Lynch’s directive left him feeling “queasy.” But, instead of appropriately pushing back on the attorney general, he somehow felt the issue wasn’t “a hill worth dying on.”  Many inside and outside of the FBI disagree. While these revelations are supremely disappointing, it is his current vainglorious effort to “set the record straight” amid the hugely consequential Russia probe that seems so reckless, foolhardy and self-serving. It appears to add credence to the president’s charge that Comey is, first and foremost, a grandstander. Comey’s book tour may indeed settle an old score. But it will undoubtedly diminish what’s left of his once-bulletproof reputation and expose to further, irreparable harm the agency he once professed to so deeply love. James A.

53,2019-04-23 00:00:00,2019,4.0,23,Brett Samuels ,Kushner says he'll present immigration plan to Trump in coming days | TheHill,"White House senior adviser Jared KushnerJared Corey KushnerPresident tweets 'few work harder' than Ivanka, Jared PETA billboard in Baltimore calls Kushner a 'rich pest' Top immigration aide experienced 'jolt of electricity to my soul' when Trump announced campaign MORE said Tuesday that he's preparing an immigration plan to present to President TrumpDonald John TrumpFacebook releases audit on conservative bias claims Harry Reid: 'Decriminalizing border crossings is not something that should be at the top of the list' Recessions happen when presidents overlook key problems MORE in the coming days. Kushner said at Time magazine's Time 100 Summit that he's put together ""a very detailed proposal"" that encompasses three major themes: improving border security, moving toward a so-called merit-based system and maintaining ""our country’s humanitarian values."" ""I do believe that the president’s position on immigration has been maybe defined by his opponents by what he’s against as opposed to what he’s for,"" Kushner said. The president has been involved in crafting the proposal, Kushner said. ""Probably at the end of this week, next week we’ll present it again and then he’ll make some changes likely, and he’ll decide what he wants to do with it,"" he said. Kushner said the border security aspect would look at using physical barriers and technology to ""keep illegal goods and keep out people who are coming in illegally while also facilitating trade and the flow of legal people as quickly and as efficiently as possible.” Kushner added that he'd like to see the U.S. immigration system give more weight to economic qualifications as opposed to family connections. He cited Canada and Australia as models for this approach. The third point, he said, is that the administration would aim to ""maintain our country’s humanitarian values."" The White House endured intense criticism last year after it implemented a policy that led to the separation of thousands of migrant families that crossed the border illegally. Kushner claimed the pitch has the support of multiple factions in the White House, including hard-liner Stephen MillerStephen MillerThe Hill's Morning Report - Trump on defense over economic jitters Top immigration aide experienced 'jolt of electricity to my soul' when Trump announced campaign New green card restrictions likely would've excluded Trump and Cuccinelli's ancestors MORE, who has been behind the administration's efforts to curb the flow of immigrants into the country and a recent leadership shakeup at the Department of Homeland Security. The president's son-in-law and adviser disputed that he and Miller have fought over the issue. ""I’ve had both Stephen Miller and [Council of Economic Advisers Chairman] Kevin Hassett involved, and I think they both agree with what this is,"" Kushner said. ""And I say that if I can get Stephen Miller and Kevin Hassett to agree on an immigration plan, then Middle East peace will be easy by comparison."" Kushner said he did not arrive in Washington intending to work on immigration, but has been working on the plan nonetheless, calling it an ""important issue"" for the country and the president. Trump has made cracking down on illegal immigration a cornerstone of his agenda dating back to his 2016 presidential campaign, when he pledged to construct a wall along the southern border and have Mexico pay for it. However, he has been unsuccessful in brokering immigration deals with congressional leaders, including notably during the record-long 35-day partial government shutdown earlier this year. Talks over reforms to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program faltered in 2017 and 2018, and Trump declared a national emergency earlier this year to secure funding for the wall following the lengthy standoff with Congress.

54,2020-03-11 00:00:00,2020,3.0,11,"Edward W. Felten, Opinion Contributor",It's time for Congress to sunset NSA's call data program | TheHill,"The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, of which I am a member, recently issued a comprehensive public report on the government's use of the now-defunct call detail records (CDR) program under the USA FREEDOM Act. The report includes never before released facts about the program and its compliance and data integrity challenges that ultimately led the National Security Agency (NSA), wisely, to suspend the program in early 2019. As Congress considers whether to reauthorize this program, I urge members of Congress to review the Board's report and reach the same conclusion I did: the program should not be restarted and should not be reauthorized. The privacy and civil liberties impacts of such a large-scale data collection program are simply too large, especially when compared to its minimal national security value. And proposals to reauthorize the program with different data miss the mark. The time has come to allow this collection authority to sunset. The CDR program was enacted in 2015 and permitted NSA to obtain an order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court requiring phone companies to send NSA call information out to two ""hops"" from a suspected number. NSA would get landline and wireless call detail records (who called whom, when, and for how long; and related information) of people who were in contact with the targeted number (the ""first hop""), along with call detail records of people who appeared in the first hop records (the ""second hop""). According to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence's 2018 Statistical Transparency Report, NSA received more than a billion CDRs from 2016 through 2018. In 2018 alone, NSA collected records including more than 19 million unique phone numbers. During this time, the program cost about $100 million but resulted in only 15 intelligence reports - a number that by NSA's own assessment is low for a program of this scale and cost. From these 15 reports, only two reports gave the FBI unique information that it would not have had access to through other legal authorities. Further, the program was plagued with repeated data integrity and compliance problems. NSA, to its credit, worked diligently to diagnose and remediate these, including deleting data that NSA had received due to providers' errors. Still, there is no indication that the conditions that led to the compliance errors are likely to change; nor can I see what NSA could do to avoid further problems should the program be restarted. Emerging technologies are dramatically raising the stakes as policymakers decide which intelligence capabilities to authorize. Terrorists and other bad actors leave information trails that can identify them and expose their plans. At the same time, we all leave a copious trail of ""data exhaust"" that can reveal intimate details of our lives. While the privacy implications of each individual piece of data may not seem terribly revealing, the collection as a whole can disclose a great deal, especially where corporate ""big data"" technologies can reveal the intricacies of our private lives in ways our grandparents never imagined. The risks and benefits of any data collection authority can be difficult to predict. It might not have been obvious in advance that court orders for two hops of CDRs from a few ""seed numbers"" would encompass the records of many millions of Americans. And it was surely not obvious that this process would be error-prone and would provide little intelligence value. Fortunately, we can learn from experience. Robust statistical reports on the uses of intelligence authorities are part of the answer, to ensure that Congress and the public understand the privacy impact of programs. Agencies have made important strides on statistical transparency. At the same time, we need independent, rigorous, and comprehensive oversight, so decisionmakers have the facts and analysis they need to make well-informed decisions. That's what the Board's report aims to provide. Some have suggested that the problem with the CDR program was not that it was too broad, but that it was too narrow-that the statute could be amended to provide multi-hop authority for other ways in which terrorists may communicate other than by telephone, such as emails and encrypted messaging. But this would only raise further difficulties and questions about the privacy and civil liberties impact of such a program. The CDR program was tailored to telephony, a technology with a century-long history. Even in this highly regulated sector, American companies encountered significant data integrity issues. There is no reason to think the compliance or data quality issues encountered in the CDR program would have been less severe for other types of communications media. Working with a tech sector where developing new capabilities without fully weighing downstream impacts is a common business practice would not be conducive to stability and data accuracy - let alone compliance. The CDR program was started in good faith, with the hope that it would yield valuable intelligence to protect the public, without too much impact on privacy and civil liberties. Those hopes were not realized. With the benefit of hindsight, we know that the program yielded little useful intelligence, impacted the privacy of millions of Americans, and struggled with data quality problems. What might have been defensible in principle turned out to be a poor bargain in operation. NSA was right to shutter the call data records program. It's time for Congress to close the book on it.

Even as conservative Republicans are making public shows of their defense of the president, calling the impeachment inquiry unfair and storming the committee hearing room Wednesday, members of the committee tasked with oversight on foreign affairs are skeptical of the former New York City mayor’s involvement in overseas policy. Some say it's not completely abnormal for diplomacy to go through back channels, but they said it should not be the norm. And several said it generally shouldn't be done. “I’m OK with that as long as they play within the confines of the law and don’t go beyond that,” Rep. Ted YohoTheodore (Ted) Scott YohoGOP lawmakers express concerns about Giuliani's work in Ukraine CNN slams GOP for not appearing on network after mass shootings, conservatives fire back Conservatives call on Pelosi to cancel August recess MORE (R-Fla.) said. “Blanket OK — no. In certain areas, yes.” Rep. John Curtis (R-Utah) called it “bad form” for outside officials to be tasked with foreign policy. “My point is — this is not the first time this has been done,” he said. “Everything from former secretaries of State being involved with foreign policy to basketball players being involved with foreign policy, and I would say that I think all of those are in bad form.” The criticisms show that even in the House, where GOP support for Trump in the impeachment inquiry is strong, some Republicans at a minimum are unnerved with actions by Giuliani and shadow efforts in general. These criticisms are echoed in testimony in the impeachment inquiry, with witnesses saying former national security adviser John BoltonJohn BoltonHouse panel advances resolution outlining impeachment inquiry Democrats raise stakes with impeachment vote The Memo: After Vindman, GOP anxiety deepens MORE called Giuliani a “hand grenade” and described his involvement in a diplomatic side channel as a “drug deal.” Secretary of State Mike PompeoMichael (Mike) Richard PompeoPompeo says Trump-Zelensky call was 'consistent' with administration policy Giuliani hits back at Trump's nominee for Russia ambassador: He 'doesn't know what he's talking about' NY Democrat presses Trump officials on terrorist designation for foreign white supremacist groups MORE on Sunday defended Giuliani’s role, however. In an appearance on ABC’s “This Week,” he said it was “completely appropriate” and that “private citizens are often part of executing American foreign policy.” Republican strategist Rick Wilson, a frequent critic of Trump’s on cable news, said House GOP members are caught in a dilemma. They risk incurring Trump’s wrath if they refuse to toe the president’s line, but they also don’t want to endorse activities they see as wrong — especially with polls showing growing support for the impeachment inquiry, especially among independents. “If they [Republicans] were being honest with you, they would tell you they know this is a disaster, and they know this is a very bad call on the president and this team,” Wilson said. Wilson said the climate has made it difficult for some Republicans to stay in Washington. He said he’d talked to one retiring House Republican who told him, “I would love to have stayed for years, but I can’t do it in this environment.” To be sure, House Republicans this week were offering a firm defense of Trump while attacking the Democratic impeachment process. Rep. Vicky HartzlerVicky Jo HartzlerGOP lawmakers express concerns about Giuliani's work in Ukraine House approves amendment to reverse transgender military ban The House-passed bills that have ended up in the Senate 'graveyard' MORE (R-Mo.), a member of the House Armed Services Committee, said she stood up with other Republicans to protest the closed-door hearings of the impeachment inquiry, calling the process “unfair.” House Minority Whip Steve ScaliseStephen (Steve) Joseph ScaliseShimkus says he's reconsidering retirement Top Republicans say impeachment resolution is too little too late Shimkus says he's been asked to reconsider retirement MORE (R-La.) called the process of the impeachment inquiry “a Soviet style process.” Hartzler, however, stopped short of defending Giuliani and other officials, like U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and Energy Secretary Rick PerryRick PerryTrump's Russia ambassador pick says he knew of Giuliani 'campaign' against ex-Ukraine envoy The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Better Medicare Alliance - ISIS leader dead; Congresswoman resigns Timeline: Trump, Ukraine and impeachment MORE, who were involved with a Ukraine side policy. “There needs to be coordination between all of government when we’re dealing with our allies who are talking about foreign policy,” said the congresswoman, who traveled on a congressional delegation to Ukraine this month.

Those problems, he said, are of U.S. policy and strategy being undermined when outside officials flout established chains of command. “Just like the military, the diplomatic chain, there's got to be integrity to the structure. There are rules and regulations governing to diplomatic communications. It's important that there be a consistent strategy amongst all the players. Anytime you have a situation where there's off-channel communications, that jeopardizes the whole system.” Fitzpatrick, who was stationed in Ukraine for his work in anti-corruption with the FBI, said it’s important the U.S. speak with one voice and that Ukraine is reassured it enjoys bipartisan support on the Hill. “My big concern right now — [Democratic Rep.] Marcy KapturMarcia (Marcy) Carolyn KapturThe National World War II Memorial is a grateful remembrance — don't let it fall apart A better way to reduce student loan debt GOP lawmakers express concerns about Giuliani's work in Ukraine MORE and I have talked about this — we need to make sure that we still send a clear message that Ukraine still enjoys bipartisan support.

According to Democrats, authorities did tell the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) that information included in the warrant request came from a politically motivated source. Democrats also say the politically motivated research, known as the Steele dossier, was not key to the application for the warrant to spy on Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

She separately had a tense moment with an NBC reporter this week when she refused to answer a question about allegations against her father of sexual misconduct. It was a stance that brought criticism from observers who said that as a White House aide, Ivanka Trump should expect such treatment. “That’s not how it works,” Meghan McCain, the daughter of Sen.

MORE (R-Ariz.), said Tuesday on ABC’s “The View.” “When you’re in, you’re in, nothing is off limits, that’s how it works … She is working in the White House and has an office in the West Wing.” All of the problems point to the complications of keeping family members in the White House — both in terms of managing staff and avoiding conflicts of interest — and to the unique weaving of the Trump brand and public service in the current administration. “It places the entire White House in an awkward position with how to handle specific circumstances and situations involving Ivanka and Jared,” said Scott Amey, general counsel at the Project on Government Oversight. The issue is most acute with Kushner, particularly after a Wednesday report in The New York Times highlighting multiple instances in which the senior aide met with financiers at the White House who later lent money to his family’s real-estate business. “We are all being given a living lesson in why governments adopt and enforce anti-nepotism standards,” said Kathleen Clark, a Washington University law professor who focuses on government ethics. “There is a related question,” she added, “which is, to what degree is the president using his public office to enrich himself and his family members?” “Stories like these attempt to make insinuating connections that do not exist to disparage the financial institutions and companies involved,” Kushner Companies spokeswoman Christine Taylor told the Times. Kushner’s troubles come at the same time that Hope HicksHope Charlotte HicksHope Hicks defends accuracy of her congressional testimony Nadler subpoenas Lewandowski, former White House official for testimony  House panel to go to court to enforce McGahn subpoena, Nadler says MORE, one of Trump’s longest-serving advisers, is leaving the White House. With Hicks's departure, Trump is losing his most trusted and loyal aide — and someone who is not in Trump’s family — at a time when he is confronting internal divisions in the White House related to family members. Her exit was announced one day after Josh Raffel, a spokesman for Kushner and Trump, said he would leave the White House. Kushner’s continued presence on the staff has frustrated some Trump allies, several of whom expressed weariness with the constant infighting “The only person whose opinion matters is the president’s. It’s his son-in-law, he’s a favorite, so nobody is going to push him out, so Jared will probably have to make the decision for himself whether the humiliation is worth it,” said one outside adviser to the Trump administration. A former White House official said there are plenty of people who would have preferred that Kushner and Ivanka Trump remained in New York, but that virtually nobody on staff is willing to challenge their presence. “[People] find a way to work within the system, unusual as it is,” said the former official, who then referenced the special counsel investigating Russia’s involvement the presidential election. “He’s an immovable object, except for, perhaps, Bob Mueller.” The idea that Trump’s business empire could be a problem for his presidency was mentioned during the campaign, but didn’t really become a huge focus until his surprising win over Democrat Hillary ClintonHillary Diane Rodham ClintonTop Sanders adviser: Warren isn't competing for 'same pool of voters' Anti-Trump vets join Steyer group in pressing Democrats to impeach Trump Republicans plot comeback in New Jersey MORE. Before taking office, Trump put his two oldest sons in charge of his businesses to counter criticism that his political career would advance his business interests. But he did not fully divest from his companies, a move watchdogs said was necessary to eliminate the possibility of conflicts. Trump announced at his Manhattan high-rise nine days before his inauguration that he would resign from his positions at his business and place his assets into trust that he would not actively manage, an effort to prevent him from taking actions as president that would enrich his businesses. But at the same time, Trump asserted that he has “a no-conflict situation because I’m president.” Kushner’s troubles and Trump Jr.’s trip give critics ammunition that Trump’s presidency is advancing his family’s business interests. The decision to give Kushner and Ivanka Trump senior positions in the White House broke with decades of precedent regarding presidential relatives’ involvement in official government business. The federal anti-nepotism law was adopted in 1967, six years after President John F. Kennedy tapped his brother, Robert, to serve as attorney general. It was intended to eliminate conflicts of interests and management problems that arise from the president’s close family serving in official roles. The Justice Department ruled one day after Trump’s inauguration that Kushner’s role would not violate the law, arguing it applies to Cabinet, but not White House, officials. Kushner played a key role in advising Trump during the campaign, which relied heavily on members of Trump’s family and political outsiders. The president was determined to staff his White House with people from his inner circle who he could trust. In a statement announcing his hiring, Trump called Kushner a “tremendous asset and trusted advisor” and also someone who has been “incredibly successful, in both business and now politics.” But accusations of a double standard have flourished. Clark pointed out that four Commerce Department officials lost their jobs over issues with their background checks, while Kushner has kept his. Doug Heye, a Republican operative, said it is normal for politicians to consult with family members about key decisions, but the equation changes when they are on staff. “It complicates things. There are loyalties there that other staff members won’t have and levels of access that could create the type of competition and infighting that we are currently seeing,” said Heye, who has worked in Congress, on the Republican National Committee and in the White House. Kushner appears increasingly to be at odds with White House chief of staff John KellyJohn Francis KellyMORE, who made the call to downgrade Kushner’s security clearance. Kelly has reportedly been frustrated with Kushner’s access to Trump, an issue that has also come up with Ivanka Trump.

The security downgrade sparked a string of anonymously sourced news stories that pitted members of Trump's family against Kelly, who was accused of using the clearance issue to carry out a vendetta against Kushner. Anthony ScaramucciAnthony ScaramucciThe Hill's 12:30 Report: Trump tries to reassure voters on economy Trump pushes back on recent polling data, says internal numbers are 'strongest we've had so far' Scaramucci assembling team of former Cabinet members to speak out against Trump MORE, who for a very brief period last summer served as the White House communications director, lashed out at Kelly publicly on Thursday, calling him “General Jackass” and blaming the chief of staff for low morale in the White House. The growing criticism of Trump’s family has frustrated the president, who believes Kushner is being treated unfairly by the media, a sentiment also shared by some Trump supporters. “Jared's done an outstanding job. I think he's been treated very unfairly,” Trump told reporters last week. “He's a high-quality person.” Trump also defended his daughter’s trip to South Korea, saying “we cannot get a better representative.” Kelly issued a statement Feb. 20 defending Kushner, saying that “everyone in the White House is grateful” for his “valuable contributions” and that “there is no truth to any suggestion otherwise.” “As I told Jared days ago, I have full confidence in his ability to continue performing his duties in his foreign policy portfolio including overseeing our Israeli-Palestinian peace effort and serving as an integral part of our relationship with Mexico,” the chief of staff said.  Jonathan Easley contributed.

Blakeman, opinion contributor",The Senate jury pool is tainted | TheHill,"Should the House impeach the president, the Senate is then charged with conducting a trial presided over by the chief justice of the Supreme Court and heard and judged by all 100 United States senators. The first thing Democrats are eager to remind the American people is that if there is a trial for removal of the president, he is not entitled to the same rights, privileges and protocols as a criminal defendant. They claim It would be a political trial with no jeopardy of life or liberty for the president. That doesn’t seem right or just. The removal of a president should not be about stripping him (or her) of due process or procedural or substantive due process, it should be on par with the rights afforded every American — especially considering that removing a president is akin to depriving Americans of their right to select a president and the term they elected him to serve. Jurors are supposed to be free from prejudice and predisposition towards the accused and the evidence. Of the 100 United States senators who will sit in judgment, six have a vested interest in conviction — since they hope to be running against the president they’d be sitting in judgment of. Sens.

Yet they may get the opportunity to do it sooner by voting for his removal in a Senate impeachment trial. Democrats should be careful what they wish for. Should the House vote for impeachment by the close of 2019, that leaves the Senate to take up a trial for removal after the first of the year in 2020. The process could last months in lead-up and actual trial. All 100 senators must be present and must remain silent until their vote is cast for either acquittal or conviction. All six Democratic senators running for president will likely be prevented from campaigning in early primary states like Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. You can’t be in two places at the same time. These senators should recuse themselves from sitting as a juror in a trial to remove the very person they are running to replace as president. The only problem with that is they can’t — for two reasons: Democrats would never be able to convict the president without them, and they can’t recuse themselves so long as they are a sitting senator. Democrats have put themselves in a no-win situation — literally. House Democrats running for president are not without taint in the process of removing their political adversary since there is no trial for removal in the Senate unless and until there is an impeachment in the House. It is unconscionable that the likely Democratic nominee for president would be in the position of participating in the removal of the person they are seeking to unseat. Democrats are engaged in subversion of a national election for president in 2020. They think they can get two chances to defeat Trump: Impeach and remove him, or use impeachment and removal to so weaken him that he will be unelectable. The crimes alleged by Democrats against the president pale in comparison to the trampling of the Constitution as Democrats seek the removal of a president they can’t beat at the polls. Democrats are using the Constitution as a sword to kill off a political adversary rather than a shield to protect the nation from abuse of power. The House is engaged in an inquisition, not an impeachment.

Democrats know they will never be able to remove this president because they don’t have the votes. This is a charade that will not be condoned by the American people.  It is not enough to hate a president out of office; you have to beat him at the ballot box. Bradley A.

An overwhelming majority of voters are concerned that the U.S. will enter a recession in 2020, according to a Hill-HarrisX poll released Monday. A majority of Republican voters -- 62 percent -- identify as both fiscally and socially conservative, according to a new Hill-HarrisX poll released on Friday. More than half of voters would not consider reelecting President Trump in 2020, according to a new poll released on Thursday. Top-tier candidates, including former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Two-thirds of voters said in a poll released Tuesday that President Trump’s next round of China tariffs will increase prices on U.S. consumer goods. Mental illness, weak gun laws and hateful public rhetoric are largely to blame for mass shootings in the United States, according to a new Hill-HarrisX poll. Just over half of Republicans — 51 percent — said in a new Hill-HarrisX poll that the federal deficit is a problem that the government needs to deal with immediately.  Less than half of U.S. voters trust companies headquartered in Mexico and China, according to a new Hill-HarrisX poll. President Trump’s job approval rating has dropped six points among voters between the ages of 18 and 34 in the latest Hill-HarrisX poll. A plurality of voters — 44 percent — say they think President Trump responds more fiercely to critics who aren’t white, according to a Hill-HarrisX poll released on Tuesday. Almost half of voters polled — 47 percent — say there was no clear winner from last week’s Democratic presidential primary debate in Detroit, according to a new Hill-HarrisX poll. Twenty-seven percent of Americans said that they thought the latest two-year budget deal would have no impact on their financial situation, according to a new poll out Friday.

An interview has reportedly not taken place or been scheduled, and the interview’s parameters were not clear, according to the outlet. Mark Zaid, an attorney for the whistleblower, declined to comment to Yahoo News. The FBI also declined to comment to the outlet. NBC News, citing a law enforcement source, reported the FBI wanted to talk to the whistleblower but was not investigating the person whose complaint launched the House impeachment inquiry. The FBI request to interview the whistleblower came after the Justice Department decided not to pursue a campaign finance investigation based on the call between Trump and the Ukrainian leader after receiving the whistleblower complaint. The Justice Department decision upset some at the FBI, according to Yahoo News, though others within the bureau were wary of getting involved. The Justice Department decision not to pursue an investigation after the whistleblower complaint was limited to the question of campaign finance laws and not other potential issues raised in the complaint, according to Yahoo News.

64,2018-05-08 00:00:00,2018,5.0,8,"Bruce Weiner, Opinion Contributor","With key legislation ready, Congress must act now to address opioid addiction | TheHill","As the opioid crisis continues its devastation across the United States, an important piece of legislation that would have an immediate impact on patients battling addiction is stuck in neutral – the Addiction Treatment Access Improvement Act of 2017. This bill would expand addiction treatment programs and access to care by enabling Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs) and other advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) to administer medication-assisted treatment that would help save thousands of lives across the country, especially in rural settings where alternative resources are scarce and addiction is rampant. The bill appeared on the House Energy & Commerce Committee’s agenda on April 25 but was never addressed. This week, the committee will get a second chance to pass the bill when it meets on Wednesday. The longer the committee waits to act, the more Americans will continue to suffer. Currently, the nation’s more than 52,000 CRNAs are prevented from treating opioid addictions with medications such as buprenorphine, which ease withdrawal symptoms and improve treatment outcomes. Many of these CRNAs are practicing in rural and underserved communities where access to physicians who are permitted to administer these treatments is limited – there are either no qualified physicians working in the area or the ones that are working are overwhelmed by patient volume, resulting in extended wait times. These communities are among the hardest hit by the opioid crisis, with staggering abuse, overdose and death statistics. By passing this measure, the CRNAs and other APRNs across the country would be granted immediate status as qualifying practitioners to provide addiction treatments in these communities. As experts in pain management and the primary pain care specialists for many patients across the nation, CRNAs have taken a lead role in addressing the current opioid crisis and offering pain management alternatives and substance use disorder treatments. Given the opioid crisis’ outsized effects on rural America, it’s imperative that we maintain enough providers in rural and underserved communities to ensure access to quality, affordable health care. CRNAs continue to be an under-utilized resource in fighting the opioid crisis as they develop innovative procedures to treat and prevent addiction, including the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols that allow patients to recover faster after surgery and decrease the reliance on opioids for post operation pain management. CRNAs are increasingly offering services in acute, chronic and interventional pain management that are opioid free or opioid sparing. This legislation is one important step in helping to turn the tide on the opioids crisis, particularly in rural America. We strongly urge the House Energy & Commerce Committee to pass the Addiction Treatment Access Improvement Act of 2017 when it meets on May 9. Bruce Weiner is president of the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists, which represents more than 52,000 nurse anesthetists.

A judge from the Northern District of California, which has cases appealed to the Ninth Circuit, dealt the administration another legal setback this week by blocking the order denying the asylum. Both courts are based in San Francisco. ""You go to the Ninth Circuit and it's a disgrace, and I'm going to put in a major complaint,"" Trump told reporters outside the White House when asked about the judge's asylum ruling. He did not elaborate on what specific action he might take. The president railed against the Ninth Circuit for nearly two minutes, claiming that ""everybody who wants to sue the United States"" does so in the California-based court because ""it means an automatic loss"" for his administration. ""You cannot win if you’re us, a case in the Ninth Circuit, and I think it’s a disgrace when people file, every case gets filed in the Ninth Circuit,"" Trump said. ""That’s not law. That’s not what this country stands for. Every case that gets filed in the Ninth Circuit, we get beaten and then we end up having to go the Supreme Court.""

Trump on Tuesday dismissed Tigar without naming him, referring to him as ""an Obama judge."" Tigar was nominated by the former president in 2012. Roughly an hour after Trump finished speaking, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders issued a statement vowing the administration ""will take all necessary action to defend the executive branch's lawful response to the crisis at our southern border.""

At a White House event earlier Tuesday, the president joked that the Ninth Circuit may attempt to overturn this year's turkey pardons. The president has, in the past, been critical of judges and courts that rule against his policies. He referred to the federal judge who initially halted the travel ban as a ""so-called judge.""

70,2020-02-23 00:00:00,2020,2.0,23,"Kristin Tate, opinion contributor",How the $23 trillion debt crisis in America affects your own money | TheHill,"For many Americans, the debt that Congress racks up year after year seems like a faraway problem, both in distance from Washington and years in the future. However, the ferocious growth of the national debt monster is one likely to consume us all sooner rather than later. While President TrumpDonald John TrumpTrump passes Pence a dangerous buck Overnight Health Care — Presented by American Health Care Association — Trump taps Pence to lead coronavirus response | Trump accuses Pelosi of trying to create panic | CDC confirms case of 'unknown' origin | Schumer wants .5 billion in emergency funds Trump nods at reputation as germaphobe during coronavirus briefing: 'I try to bail out as much as possible' after sneezes MORE seems to be allowing the problem to grow, Democrats are ready to let it sink the economy and your financial stake in it. Debt crises have a particular way of fomenting deep political and social change. Before the French Revolution, the country struggled with massive debt from spending on war, colonies, and major projects like the Palace of Versailles. As historian John Shovlin noted, “It is a truism that the French Revolution was touched off by the near bankruptcy of the state.” During the European debt crisis in the last decade, Cyprus accepted a bailout that required its citizens to foot much of the bill. The original plan was for all private bank accounts to pay in to cover costs. In the rejected plan, accounts under 100,000 euros were to have more than 6 percent in assets seized by the state, and those accounts above 100,000 euros were to have nearly 10 percent taken. The actual deal took between 40 percent to 60 percent of assets from the accounts above 100,000 euros. If Cyprus forced its own citizens to give up their already taxed earnings to cover that $23 billion debt bailout, imagine how our federal government would handle a debt load 1,000 times larger. The outstanding $23 trillion is one that neither political party in Washington is willing to tackle. Trump allowed for massive spending, even during healthy economic times. When the next terrible recession hits the country, the bailout package might not be for the large banks, but rather for Washington to keep functioning. There might be a bit of light at the end of the tunnel. The White House budget intends to reduce government largesse with proposals to trim the edges, including $53 billion in contract abuses, $18 billion in improper tax refunds, and closer oversight on federal agency spending. In many ways, however, these are relative window dressing for an annual deficit that is approaching $1 trillion and likely growing. The fact that Congress will not accept this budget as written means the can will be kicked further down the road. After all, Congress rejected modest cuts three years ago. While Trump is letting this problem to develop much further, Democrats seem to want to create an even more serious debt crisis during the next administration. For starters, the spending plans by the candidates make Trump and even Barack Obama look like skinflints. Gone are the days that John Kerry wanted to look like a fiscal hawk by attacking George Bush for $87 billion to be spent on the Iraq War. The Democrats who are seeking the White House this fall are using their soapboxes to call for multitrillion spending proposals without any spelled out means to pay for them. Then there are promises of steep new taxes, onerous regulations that will kill the financial and energy gains of the last three years, and an unbridled sense of federal power, Democrats will pair this tremendous spending with an almost guaranteed recession. Considering that the last recession almost toppled multiple European countries, how will the United States handle a worse recession with much higher debt loads? Democrats have made plans based on the false assumption that economic growth can reduce the deficit, while they craft policies to induce another crash. Even the Trump tax cuts were partially based on some similar assumptions without major budget cuts. When that happens, what will be the effect on your wallet? First, the reality of an economic “bail in” similar to Cyprus is always present. Second, the last time the government pushed debt above 100 percent of gross domestic product was due to the Second World War, when the government had asked citizens to pitch in by buying bonds. Massive debt spending is often followed by a massive hangover, just as spending on social initiatives, the Vietnam War, and the oil crises of the 1970s led to harmful stagflation. A combination of taxes, high inflation, and unemployment sunk the economy before the reforms under Ronald Reagan. If Democrats are looking for a clear precedent for their current economic plans, including a ban on fracking, they can look no further. Our public debt has been partially obfuscated by outside factors such as economic growth and budget gimmicks. However, as it grows, the options to handle it become fewer. The impending cost of the Social Security and Medicare needs of the Baby Boomers will provide a stark choice between reducing benefits, cutting taxes, or both. Since the Social Security trust fund is estimated to expire in 15 years, all the Democratic proposals to expand expenses will only hasten the day that checks are reduced. Crushing debt is something that many Americans understand in their personal lives when it comes to delaying plans, paralyzing action, and lowering standards of living. Whether we like it or not, we contributed to the same concept, millions of times over, in Washington. When a credit card bill comes due, an individual could declare bankruptcy. When the government has its debt bill come due, all of us will be on the hook. Kristin Tate is a libertarian writer and an analyst for Young Americans for Liberty.

71,2019-07-10 00:00:00,2019,7.0,10,Rafael Bernal ,Report finds Hispanic voter participation outpacing non-Hispanics in key states | TheHill,"Hispanic voter registration and turnout rates are increasing at a faster clip than rates for the general population, particularly in key 2020 states, according to an analysis of voter data published by Univision on Wednesday. The report found that, from 2014 to 2018, Hispanic voter turnout increased at a faster pace than non-Hispanic turnout in Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania. The report comes amid the controversy surrounding the Trump administration’s efforts to add a citizenship question on the U.S. census. Critics argue adding the citizenship question could decrease participation in the census by Hispanic households, which could effect how legislative districts are drawn and how federal money is divided up and apportioned. The Univision report also shows that more new Hispanic people are registering to vote in many states. In New Mexico, nearly half of new registrations for 2018 were Hispanic, as were one in three new Arizona registrations, and one in five Colorado registrations. Low voter registration has historically dogged the Hispanic electorate, as multiple factors, including historical geographic concentration in relatively few states, have disincentivized Hispanic electoral participation. Univision put out a report in April, showing triple-digit growth in Hispanic voter participation in the states with the largest Latino populations: California, Florida, Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey, New York and Texas. “This new data from seven additional states further demonstrates that Hispanic voters are a crucial demographic and any candidate or issue group that wants to win must get their message out to Latinos,” said Sandusky.Hispanic voters are participating at higher rates, regardless of party affiliation. While Democratic turnout is increasing more rapidly overall than Republican turnout, independent Hispanic voter turnout growth outpaced Democratic growth in all states surveyed. In Ohio, for instance, Hispanic independent turnout increased 133 percent (the increase among non-Hispanic independents was 63 percent) while Republican Hispanic turnout increased 70 percent and Democratic Hispanic turnout increased 60 percent. Democratic Hispanic turnout growth outpaced Republican growth in Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. The numbers reflect an increasingly energized Hispanic electorate, as participation increases outpace the demographic growth of Hispanic communities nationwide. View the discussion thread.

So far, the former vice president has retained strong support from voters in South Carolina. A couple of recent surveys showed approximately one-third of likely voters in the Palmetto State plan to support Biden. A Quinnipiac poll showed him leading Warren by 20 points, and a survey conducted by the University of North Florida showed Biden holding a commanding lead with 36 percent of likely voters, with both Warren and Sanders trailing by more than 26 points. But strategists say that doesn’t mean those voters are locked in, particularly if other candidates begin to pick up speed between now and Feb. 29, when the South Carolina primary takes place. ""Savvy black voters will reassess their options,"" said Basil Smikle, a Democratic strategist who served as a campaign aide to 2016 presidential nominee Hillary ClintonHillary Diane Rodham ClintonThree legal scholars say Trump should be impeached; one thinks otherwise Report: Barr attorney can't provide evidence Trump was set up by DOJ Jayapal pushes back on Gaetz's questioning of impeachment witness donations to Democrats MORE. ""Every candidate will have to remake their case to, and reaffirm their policy prescriptions for, the African American community — Biden included."" Another strategist was more direct: “The support won’t be there if he’s slipping. There’s just no way.” But Biden allies say they’re on firm footing in the state and they don’t anticipate that changing, even if he comes in behind other candidates in one of the earlier states. “The South Carolina firewall has proven pretty resilient because of his connection with African American voters,” one longtime ally said. “It endured the surge of other flavor-of-the-month candidates. It can certainly endure him finishing in a jumble of candidates at the top of the heap in Iowa and New Hampshire.” “Blowout losses in one of those states would be the real test but it also matters who he’s losing to and how the rest of the field reacts to the results of Iowa and New Hampshire,” the ally added. “If a boy mayor who has been famously unable to connect with African Americans is the hot hand coming out of Iowa, Biden’s support might even grow, because presumably by then [Sens. Kamala] Harris and [Cory] Booker will be out of the race themselves and their voters seem more likely to become Biden voters,” the ally said of Buttigieg, who has struggled to gain support among black voters. Biden could also be bolstered by national polls, where he has continued to beat out his competitors. A CNN poll out on Wednesday showed him receiving 28 percent among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents. He was followed by Sanders at 17 percent and Warren at 14 percent. Buttigieg, who climbed in the poll, came in at 11 percent. And political observers say there are other scenarios that could help Biden prevail in South Carolina, especially in a field that is still growing at this late stage in the primary season.   “A lot of water is going to pass under the bridge between now and February. Scenarios abound, especially if, as is likely, there are still a dozen or more candidates in the field when voting starts,” said Cal Jillson, a professor of political science at Southern Methodist University. “If two different people win in Iowa and New Hampshire and Biden is close and competitive, then South Carolina could buoy him up and send him into Super Tuesday with some momentum.” Still Jillson acknowledged that if Biden finishes out of the top three in both of the first two events, “sentiments could shift quickly against him.” In recent days, as Buttigieg has soared to the top of polls in Iowa and even one in New Hampshire, Biden has focused on Iowa “with renewed intensity,” Jillson said. Biden’s campaign launched an ad this week in Iowa highlighting his experience and his ability to “stand with our allies and know them by their first names.” Next week, he is set to begin an eight-day bus tour of the Hawkeye State, hoping to make up some lost ground and connect with voters as caucus day inches closer. The Democratic strategist said Biden should devote more resources to Iowa and New Hampshire or he’ll be disappointed in South Carolina. “One thing leads to another,” the strategist said. “You don’t win states in a vacuum.” View the discussion thread.

73,2018-02-20 00:00:00,2018,2.0,20,"Joan Maya Mazelis, opinion contributor","Punishing the poor isn’t just bad policy, it’s wasting taxpayer money | TheHill","President Reagan labeled poor people as “welfare queens” back in the 1970s, but our nation’s stigma against the poor is as strong as ever. And as a result, misguided welfare policies — like drug testing recipients of public assistance — are making a comeback. Just look at the White House’s most recent assaults on America’s poor. In the past few weeks, the federal government opened the door to work requirements for people who receive housing subsidies and Medicaid coverage. States see an opening for various ways to limit Medicaid benefits and cover fewer people. The White House is also proposing cutting off millions of people who receive food assistance and limiting the food choice for those who still get benefits. These policies focus on policing behavior rather than addressing needs. And that’s because they are based on stigma, not facts. Despite their popularity, these types of changes don’t guarantee an escape from poverty or a better life. Instead, they further demean poor Americans and make their lives more difficult.   To understand the depth of our nation’s stigma against the poor, let’s look at our track record with drug tests. There is overwhelming evidence that drug testing recipients of assistance saves no money and identifies few drug users, despite claims from prominent Republicans. The popularity of drug testing welfare recipients shows the power of the widespread belief that poverty and drugs go hand in hand. The idea that welfare recipients are criminals who use illicit substances is a well-worn stereotype about the so-called undeserving poor. And it has real consequences for their lives. People often mistakenly thought Rebecca, a poor woman in her early 30s I interviewed in Philadelphia, was a drug addict because she had no teeth. Many poor people without access to dental care find that the cheapest way to treat a serious tooth problem is to have it pulled, especially when dental issues go untreated until it’s too late for other interventions.  Rebecca longed for enough money to afford dentures, telling me she couldn’t wait to get a job “as soon as I get my teeth.” The irony of Rebecca — and so many others — losing medical assistance because she isn’t fulfilling work requirements is that affordable care is precisely what would help her secure work.  Meanwhile, misperceptions about poor people using drugs have led multiple states to pass legislation to drug test applicants or recipients of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. Now, states are seeking to drug test Medicaid recipients as well. Because testing eligible recipients costs more than the money that would be saved by withholding benefits from the tiny percentage who test positive, drug testing is not cost-effective.  Florida taxpayers, for example, spent $118,140 to reimburse people who tested negative for the cost of testing, which was $45,780 more than the state saved by denying benefits to the 2.6 percent of applicants who tested positive. And other states are doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. Appeals courts declared the drug testing laws unconstitutional. But Florida spent hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars to fight to overturn the ruling in court, and that means even more taxpayer money spent on these already costly and unwise policies. It comes as no surprise that states and the White House are reviving similar limits on Medicaid and housing programs as well. Our elected leaders are misinformed about the issue and rely on stereotypes of the poor to make these decisions. During his term as Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett claimed — in complete defiance of the evidence — “many employers…say we’re looking for people but we can’t find anybody that has passed a drug test, a lot of them.” Statements like this translate into policies that punish and stigmatize the poor without saving any money. They also feed the public’s doubt in the moral worth of those experiencing poverty. It implies that poor people use drugs; otherwise, why would we even be considering such tests? The fact that our public officials continue to waste taxpayer dollars makes clear that stigmatizing poor people is a higher priority than either sensible spending or helping the poor. The moral problem before us is not drug use or laziness, but rather the pervasive belief that poor people do not deserve our help unless they meet an arbitrary standard we do not apply to anyone else.   It’s time we had policies to aid the most vulnerable among us that are based on evidence instead of derogatory stereotypes. Money spent on drug testing poor people — or on ensuring recipients of housing subsidies or Medicaid are fulfilling work requirements — would be better spent on affordable housing, increased child care subsidies, and the creation of jobs that pay a living wage.

Speier acknowledged that the president has said he would be open to a public release of the report. But she noted that Trump once vowed to release his tax returns. ""I mean, this is no different than everything else President Trump has done during his entire campaign and election,"" she said. ""He also said he wanted to release his tax returns. We’re still waiting 2 1/2 years later for that tax return and he doesn’t talk about it anymore."" ""He doesn’t talk about a rigged election after he won the election,"" Speier continued. ""He is a man who will do whatever is convenient at the time, knowing that he can use it somehow later. And in this case I think he has a deal with Mitch McConnell."" Attorney General William Barr on Sunday sent Congress a four-page summary that said special counsel Robert Mueller did not uncover evidence to conclude the Trump campaign coordinated with the Kremlin during the 2016 presidential election. It's not clear if Mueller's full report will ever be completely released, though Barr has pledged to be as transparent as possible. The report is likely to need redactions, and there are Department of Justice guidelines intended to protect people who have not been indicted from the release of information collected in an investigation of them. But there is tremendous pressure on Justice to release the full report and the evidence it is based upon. McConnell has twice blocked a nonbinding resolution demanding its public release. There is particular interest on how Barr determined that no obstruction of justice charge should be made against Trump. Barr's letter noted that Mueller did not reach a definitive conclusion on whether Trump obstructed justice during the probe. But Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein decided Mueller did not provide sufficient evidence of obstruction of justice to pursue it. The letter states that the investigation does not exonerate Trump of obstruction of justice.  Speier's use of the word collusion is likely to get the attention of Republicans.  Trump and many GOP lawmakers have argued that the summary shows that Democrats and the media promoted a false narrative about alleged collusion over the last two years between Trump and his campaign and Moscow.

Defense Secretary James MattisJames Norman MattisOnly Donald Trump has a policy for Afghanistan New Pentagon report blames Trump troop withdrawal for ISIS surge in Iraq and Syria Mattis returns to board of General Dynamics MORE approved a request for assistance from the Department of Homeland Security to send the troops as part of Operation Faithful Patriot. The Pentagon this week began deploying more than 5,200 troops to Texas, Arizona and California, with another roughly 2,000 on standby. Defense officials have not given a cost estimate for the deployment, nor specified the national security threat at the border.  Reed criticized the administration for failing to provide “indication to the Senate Armed Services Committee that the migrant caravan — still about 1,000 miles and weeks away from reaching the U.S. southern border — poses a direct national security threat to the United States.” Instead of redirecting troops from their current missions, Trump should “first exhaust all diplomatic and humanitarian means,” he added. Reed also said Trump’s recent caravan comments “mischaracterize the situation, are unlikely to achieve effective border security, and do not reflect the best attributes of our country.” Trump in the past month has increasingly portrayed the caravan as a national security threat as midterm elections creep closer. With the midterm elections on Tuesday and control of the House and Senate in the balance, the president has painted the group of mostly women and children as full of dangerous individuals. And on Wednesday, Trump said that he might deploy up to 15,000 service members to stop people from the ""very dangerous"" caravan from crossing the border. Administration officials have defended the move to send troops, including Mattis, who on Wednesday pushed back on criticisms that the deployment was a political stunt from the Trump administration. “We don’t do stunts in this department,” Mattis told reporters. In his letter, Reed urges Trump to provide a full account of the financial costs of the troop border deployment “as well as the impacts it will have on any ongoing military missions.” And rather than troop deployment, Reed asks that Trump “send an appropriate team of diplomatic and Homeland Security Department officials to southern Mexico to inform the migrants that they will not be permitted to simply enter the United States.” He also said the president should provide “a commitment of support and assistance” to the Mexican government and refugee agencies seeking to provide food and temporary shelter for the migrants, as well as “offer to help enhance the ability of the Mexican government to process any asylum claims.” These steps “would demonstrate leadership and strength rather than fear and weakness when it comes to protecting our border,” Reed concludes.

The Michigan consumer sentiment index fell to 90.7, a drop of 7.7 percentage points from December 2018 and the lowest level since October 2016.   Richard Curtin, the survey’s chief economist, pinned January’s sharp decline to a slew of economic headwinds and headaches facing consumers and investors. “The loss was due to a host of issues including the partial government shutdown, the impact of tariffs, instabilities in financial markets, the global slowdown and the lack of clarity about monetary policies,” Curtin said. Michigan’s monthly confidence survey is closely watched by economists and analysts as an indicator of future consumer behavior. Sharp declines in confidence can often preview difficulty for the U.S. economy, which depends heavily on steady consumer spending. Consumer confidence surged after Trump’s election. Republicans and Wall Street rallied on Trump’s promises to cut taxes and rip up regulations, while Democrats expected the economy to hold strong after years of moderate growth under former President Obama.  The U.S. economy still boasts unemployment near record lows and solid growth, but Trump’s trade battles with China and Europe, the 28-day government shutdown, stock market volatility and slowdowns in emerging market economies have dampened the domestic outlook. Analysts expect the pace of U.S. growth to slow in 2019, but say the shutdown poses a dire threat to the economy.  More than 800,000 federal workers have missed paychecks during the shutdown, which could trigger a recession, according to projections from economists in the White House and private sector. Curtin said the January confidence drop “is consistent with a slowdown in the pace growth,” but “does not yet indicate the start of a sustained downturn.” View the discussion thread.

If she chooses not to exercise these options, HHS does not believe we are required to facilitate Jane Moe’s abortion, out of concern and responsibility for the mother’s best interests.” The ACLU asked the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Thursday for a temporary restraining order for Moe so she could obtain an abortion.  According to court documents, Moe is a 17-year-old unaccompanied immigrant minor living in a government-funded shelter. Moe is in her second trimester of pregnancy.  She first requested an abortion two weeks ago, but her request has been denied.  This is the fourth time the ORR has tried to block immigrant minors in the care of the U.S. from getting abortions.  In the previous cases, the minors have been eventually allowed to obtain abortions.  In March, the administration established a policy of prohibiting all federally funded shelters from taking ""any action that facilitates"" abortion access for unaccompanied minors without the approval of ORR Director Scott Lloyd.  The ACLU argues the policy is unconstitutional.

""Their is no reason for the U.S. Consumer to pay the Tariffs, which take effect on China today,” Trump wrote in one of the posts on Twitter. In a second tweet, he said a consumer could ""buy the product inside the USA (the best idea)."" He said companies would leave China for other countries, such as Vietnam, to avoid the tariffs.   Their is no reason for the U.S. Consumer to pay the Tariffs, which take effect on China today.

Also, the Tariffs can be.....   ....completely avoided if you by from a non-Tariffed Country, or you buy the product inside the USA (the best idea). That’s Zero Tariffs.

Most economists agree that the costs of the tariffs will be paid by U.S. consumers in the form of higher prices on imported products from China. Kudlow did say that China would suffer, too, from the fight, saying they would be hit by gross domestic product losses and a diminishing export market. The Trump administration announced it would hike tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese products on Friday. Tariffs that were 10 percent are jumping to 25 percent.  It's unclear how easy it would be for U.S. consumers to avoid higher prices coming because of the tariffs. It's also not clear yet how prices will be effected, since the tariffs only went into effect on Chinese products leaving China on Friday. China is also expected to retaliate against the U.S. by imposing higher tariffs on U.S. products sent to China. Trump has repeatedly argued that past U.S. presidents have bungled negotiations with China and that his hard-edged effort will boost the U.S. economy. In a subsequent tweet on Monday, he wrote that the U.S. economy's solid first-quarter growth was aided by the tariffs on China. “The unexpectedly good first quarter 3.2% GDP was greatly helped by Tariffs from China,” Trump tweeted. “Some people just don’t get it!” The unexpectedly good first quarter 3.2% GDP was greatly helped by Tariffs from China.

81,2018-11-19 20:23:25,2018,11.0,19,Alan Feuer,El Chapo Witness Details Brutal Drug War Murders,"[What you need to know to start your day: Get New York Today in your inbox] The stories of narco-violence piled up high on Monday as jurors at the trial of Joaquín Guzmán Loera heard gruesome testimony about six separate brutal drug war murders. One of the victims nearly had his head cut off by a fusillade of gunfire. Another was killed on his doorstep after being lured from home when he was told, falsely, that his son had just been run down by a car. A third made a small, but fatal, error: He refused one day to shake Mr. Guzmán’s hand. Last week, the federal prosecutors trying Mr. Guzmán, the Mexican drug kingpin known as El Chapo, offered evidence about the gothic bloodshed his cartel routinely committed. But as the proceeding entered its second week, the government began to tie that violence directly to Mr. Guzmán. Instead of these gory tales, the courtroom audience had expected a prosecution witness, Jesus Zambada García, to confess to a bombshell act of corruption. Last week, in a private sidebar conversation, Mr. Guzmán’s lawyers said that Mr. Zambada would testify to having paid at least $6 million to the “incumbent president of Mexico.” That testimony never came on Monday, but it may on Tuesday when Mr. Zambada returns to the stand. But no less than a half-dozen times on Monday, Mr. Zambada, said that Mr. Guzmán, his former boss in the Sinaloa drug cartel, had arranged for people to be killed for seemingly minor reasons. In what was Mr. Zambada’s third day as a witness, Mr. Guzmán emerged as a kind of gun-loving hothead who owned a diamond-encrusted pistol with his initials on the handle and who once relaxed by taking target practice with a bazooka. From the start of the trial, which is being held in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, prosecutors have accused Mr. Guzmán not only of earning $14 billion by routinely shipping ton-size batches of drugs into the United States, but also of taking part in more than 30 murders. Mr. Zambada began on Monday to describe some of those killings, starting with the slaying of Rodolfo Carrillo Fuentes, a former member of the Sinaloa cartel. In 2004, he said, Mr. Guzmán and Mr. Carrillo Fuentes were rivals as part of a larger war between the Sinaloa traffickers and a vicious gang, the Zetas, with whom Mr. Carrillo Fuentes had allied himself. At a meeting to restore the peace, Mr. Guzmán’s longtime partner, Ismael Zambada García, tried to broker a truce. But when Mr. Guzmán put his hand out Mr. Carrillo Fuentes did not take it. Not long after, Mr. Zambada said, armed assassins lay in wait for Mr. Carrillo Fuentes and his unsuspecting wife, gunning both down as they exited a movie theater in Culiacán. “Chapo said he was going to kill him,” Mr. Zambada told the jury. The next year, a similar fate befell Julio Beltran-Leyva, another one of Mr. Guzmán’s former allies. According to Mr. Zambada, Mr. Beltran-Leyva had disobeyed an order not to send a shipment of cocaine from Acapulco. At Mr. Guzmán’s behest, Mr. Zambada testified, a team of assassins attacked Mr. Beltran-Leyva, firing so many rifle rounds at him that his head was left dangling from his neck. It was clear from Monday’s testimony that drug trafficking, especially in Mr. Guzmán’s orbit, was not an occupation that promoted health or longevity. People around him seemed to die with alarming frequency. There was, for instance, his younger brother, Arturito Guzmán, who was murdered in prison on New Year’s Eve in 2004. There was also a police officer who usually stayed at home out of fear, but walked outside into a spray of bullets after one of Mr. Guzmán’s killers knocked on his door and shouted a lie: that his child had just been hit by a car. Even those who endured the violence surrounding Mr. Guzmán required a level of machismo to survive. One gunman, caught in the crossfire of Mr. Beltran-Leyva’s murder, was knocked unconscious for five or 10 minutes with a head wound, Mr. Zambada said. When he finally awoke, the gunman dismissed the wound as “a scratch.” William Purpura, one of Mr. Guzmán’s lawyers, asked Mr. Zambada a few questions on Monday afternoon, largely pointing out that in prior statements he had never mentioned Mr. Guzmán in connection with some of the murders the government accused him of committing. Mr. Purpura also suggested that Mr. Zambada was a liar who could say whatever he wanted since most of the people who could corroborate — or refute — his account were already dead. Mr. Purpura noted that Juan José Esparragoza, Mr. Guzmán’s mentor, who knew him better than anyone, was dead — and so was Mr. Guzmán’s brother, Arturito. Mr. Guzman’s former ally, Amado Carrillo Fuentes — a brother of Rodolfo — was also deceased, Mr. Purpura said, having bled to death in 1997 while undergoing plastic surgery. “All of them are dead,” Mr. Purpura told the witness. “So there’s really no one but you, correct?” Mr. Zambada readily agreed. “Fortunately,” he said, “I’m alive.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/19/nyregion/el-chapo-trial.html,nyregion,The New York Times
82,2018-11-26 06:00:04,2018,11.0,26,N. Ángel Pinillos,"Opinion | Knowledge, Ignorance and Climate Change","The Stone Philosophers have been talking about skepticism for a long time. Some of those insights can shed light on our public discourse regarding climate change. Dr. Pinillos is a professor of philosophy at Arizona State University. No matter how smart or educated you are, what you don’t know far surpasses anything you may know. Socrates taught us the virtue of recognizing our limitations. Wisdom, he said, requires possessing a type of humility manifested in an awareness of one’s own ignorance. Since then, the value of being aware of our ignorance has been a recurring theme in Western thought: René Descartes said it’s necessary to doubt all things to build a solid foundation for science; and Ludwig Wittgenstein, reflecting on the limits of language, said that “the difficulty in philosophy is to say no more than we know.” Awareness of ignorance appears to be common in politics as well. In a recent “60 Minutes” interview, President Trump said of global warming, “I don’t know that it’s man-made.” The same sentiment was echoed by Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council. Perhaps Trump and Kudlow, confident in their ignorance on these important issues, are simply expressing philosophical humility and wisdom. Or perhaps not. Sometimes, when it appears that someone is expressing doubt, what he is really doing is recommending a course of action. For example, if I tell you that I don’t know whether there is milk in the fridge, I’m not exhibiting philosophical wisdom — I’m simply recommending that you check the fridge before you go shopping. From this perspective, what Trump is doing is telling us that governmental decisions should not assume that global warming is caused by humans. According to NASA, at least 97 percent of actively publishing climate scientists think that “climate-warming trends over the past century are extremely likely caused by human activities.” Americans overwhelmingly agree that the federal government needs to take significant action. In a recent poll conducted by Stanford University, ABC News and Resources for the Future, 61 percent of those surveyed said that the federal government should take a great deal or a lot of action to curb global warming. And an additional 19 percent believe that the government should take moderate action. As a philosopher, I have nothing to add to the scientific evidence of global warming, but I can tell you how it’s possible to get ourselves to sincerely doubt things, despite abundant evidence to the contrary. I also have suggestions about how to fix this. To understand how it’s possible to doubt something despite evidence to the contrary, try some thought experiments. Suppose you observe a shopper at the convenience store buying a lottery ticket. You are aware that the probability that he will lose the lottery is astronomically high, typically above 99.99 percent, but it’s hard to get yourself to sincerely say you know this person will lose the lottery. Now imagine your doctor screens you for a disease, and the test comes out negative. But consider the possibility that this result is one of those rare “false negative” cases. Do you really know the result of this particular test is not a false negative? These scenarios suggest that it’s possible to feel as though you don’t know something even when possessing enormous evidence in its favor. Philosophers call scenarios like these “skeptical pressure” cases, and they arise in mundane, boring cases that have nothing to do with politics or what one wants to be true. In general, a skeptical pressure case is a thought experiment in which the protagonist has good evidence for something that he or she believes, but the reader is reminded that the protagonist could have made a mistake. If the story is set up in the right way, the reader will be tempted to think that the protagonist’s belief isn’t genuine knowledge. When presented with these thought experiments, some philosophy students conclude that what these examples show is that knowledge requires full-blown certainty. In these skeptical pressure cases, the evidence is overwhelming, but not 100 percent. It’s an attractive idea, but it doesn’t sit well with the fact that we ordinarily say we know lots of things with much lower probability. For example, I know I will be grading student papers this weekend. Although the chance of this happening is high, it is not anything close to 100 percent, since there is always the chance I’ll get sick, or that something more important will come up. In fact, the chance of getting sick and not grading is much higher than the chance of winning the lottery. So how could it be that I know I will be grading and not know that the shopper at the convenience store will lose the lottery? Philosophers have been studying skeptical pressure intensely for the past 50 years. Although there is no consensus about how it arises, a promising idea defended by the philosopher David Lewis is that skeptical pressure cases often involve focusing on the possibility of error. Once we start worrying and ruminating about this possibility, no matter how far-fetched, something in our brains causes us to doubt. The philosopher Jennifer Nagel aptly calls this type of effect “epistemic anxiety.” In my own work, I have speculated that an extreme version of this phenomenon is operative in obsessive compulsive disorder, a condition that affects millions of Americans. In many cases of O.C.D., patients are paralyzed with doubt about some fact — against all evidence. For example, a patient might doubt whether she turned off her stove despite having just checked multiple times. As with skeptical pressure cases, the focus on the possibility that one might be wrong plays a central role in the phenomenon. Let’s return to climate change skepticism. According to social psychology, climate change deniers tend to espouse conservative views, which suggests that party ideology is partly responsible for these attitudes. I think that we should also think about the philosophical nature of skeptical reactions, an apolitical phenomenon. The standard response by climate skeptics is a lot like our reaction to skeptical pressure cases. Climate skeptics understand that 97 percent of scientists disagree with them, but they focus on the very tiny fraction of holdouts. As in the lottery case, this focus might be enough to sustain their skepticism. We have seen this pattern before. Anti-vaccine proponents, for example, aware that medical professionals disagree with their position, focus on any bit of fringe research that might say otherwise. Skeptical allure can be gripping. Piling on more evidence does not typically shake you out of it, just as making it even more probable that you will lose the lottery does not all of a sudden make you feel like you know your ticket is a loser. One way to counter the effects of skepticism is to stop talking about “knowledge” and switch to talking about probabilities. Instead of saying that you don’t know some claim, try to estimate the probability that it is true. As hedge fund managers, economists, policy researchers, doctors and bookmakers have long been aware, the way to make decisions while managing risk is through probabilities. Once we switch to this perspective, claims to “not know,” like those made by Trump, lose their force and we are pushed to think more carefully about the existing data and engage in cost-benefit analyses. Interestingly, people in the grips of skepticism are often still willing to accept the objective probabilities. Think about the lottery case again. Although you find it hard to say you know the shopper will lose the lottery, you readily agree that it is still very probable that he will lose. What this suggests is that even climate skeptics could budge on their estimated likelihood of climate change without renouncing their initial skepticism. It’s easy to say you don’t know, but it’s harder to commit to an actual low probability estimate in the face of overwhelming contrary evidence. Socrates was correct that awareness of one’s ignorance is virtuous, but philosophers have subsequently uncovered many pitfalls associated with claims of ignorance. An appreciation of these issues can help elevate public discourse on important topics, including the future of our planet. N.

83,2019-07-24 05:00:11,2019,7.0,24,Suzy Hansen,‘The Era of People Like You Is Over’: How Turkey Purged Its Intellectuals,"For more than a century, one school of political science dominated the education of Turkey’s governing class — until the Erdogan regime set about destroying it. CreditCredit Above: Former members of the Ankara University faculty of political science, also known as Mulkiye, including Canberk Gurer, Ilhan Uzgel, Elcin Aktoprak and Kerem Altiparmak. Photographs by Emin Ozmen/Magnum, for The New York Times. Ilhan Uzgel learned he had been fired while driving his Honda Civic from the village of Ayas to Ankara, after a visit to his ailing, elderly father. A little after midnight, one of his former research assistants called his cellphone. “Ilhan hocam,” the student said, using a Turkish honorific (“my teacher”) bestowed on educators. “Your name was on the list.” When Uzgel returned to his Ankara apartment, his 4-year-old son was sleeping, but his wife, Elcin Aktoprak, was up waiting. She hadn’t wanted to call him herself with the news while he was driving. Now she comforted her husband — and then Uzgel comforted her, because Aktoprak, also a professor, told him that she had lost her job, too. They had been professors at Ankara University, on the faculty of its storied school of political science, widely known as Mulkiye. Uzgel attended a provincial university in his home city, Bursa, before enrolling in Mulkiye to get a master’s degree and eventually his doctorate — an accomplishment for someone of his modest origins. In Turkey, to be a part of Mulkiye was to have a special status: to be both of the country and, in a way, superior to it. The joke went that for Mulkiyeliler, or Mulkiye alumni, it was “First Mulkiye, then Turkiye.” Uzgel, one of Turkey’s leading specialists in American-Turkish relations and the author or editor of books with grand titles like “National Interest and Foreign Policy,” proudly remained at Mulkiye for 30 years until Feb. 7, 2017, when he was fired. Some 6,000 of Turkey’s 150,000 academics would ultimately share his fate. Many Turkish academics grew up hoping that they would one day see their country become a democracy. They studied sociology or philosophy; they specialized in conflict resolution, peace building, minority rights, things like the creation of civil society. They received their Ph.D.s in political science or history, expressly to participate in liberal-minded universities that would bring forth generations even more democratic than themselves. They had faith in things like good governance practices, a fair judicial system, a free press, human rights and women’s rights. There was a goal, and an understanding that you were either part of democratization or you weren’t. In Turkey, those who engaged in the creation of a democracy as a painful, step-by-step process constituted a small, passionate group, but they shared this experience with people all across the world, from Poland to Taiwan, with those who also lived in democratizing countries, who felt that their countries were on the upswing, getting better, whatever that meant. An authoritarian state can do many things to get rid of these democratic types — put them in jail, put them on trial — but ultimately the government must attack the institutions that produce and sustain them. Newspapers can be easy to buy. NGOs are easy to shut down. Universities are much harder to dismantle. But this is what, through the great purge, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his allies sought to do. Thousands of academics lost their jobs, and many lost their right to travel, their passports canceled. They would not be able to work at public or private universities again. Legal proceedings would be opened against them — and drag on to this day, leaving the fired in limbo. Many who were abroad would not return. They feared being quoted in the press or even speaking to journalists. Some were sentenced to prison. At least one committed suicide. Around 90 of the purged academics came from Ankara University, and 36 came from Mulkiye alone, raising suspicions that the 160-year-old faculty of political science had become a particular target. In October 2017, months after the firings began, Mulkiye held a conference called “The One Hundredth Anniversary of the Russian Revolution: The Soviet Union, the Cold War and the International System.” Uzgel was the keynote speaker. In order to attend the conference, he had to be brought discreetly onto campus in a friend’s car. In his speech, Uzgel, a small, soft-spoken man in his mid-50s with wispy, longish gray hair, spoke about recent events, particularly the failed military coup against Erdogan only 15 months earlier, as well as the previous successful military coups in Turkey’s history. “In 1980, when there was a military coup, the threat was the Soviet Union, and it was academics who paid the price,” he said. “In 2016, when there was a military coup, the threat was the United States, and still it was we who paid the price. The threat changes, but those who are fired stay the same. Academics pay the price.” Uzgel’s voice began to crack. Almost every day since his 20s, he had taken the bus or driven his car to the university’s stately campus in Ankara’s busy, wide-laned central Cebeci neighborhood; entered through the imposing concrete gates surrounded by lush foliage, then passed through the doors to the early modernist structure that served as Mulkiye’s home; walked across the inner courtyard where young men and women smoked many cigarettes and fought about politics; and climbed the floating staircase, flanked by paintings and photographs of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, to arrive at his office. His life’s work, his status in the country, had now been stolen from him. As Uzgel pointed out in his speech, Turkey’s governments have often purged the country’s intellectuals, only for the nation to stumble slowly back toward some semblance of democracy. As the Turks proved again this past June, when they resoundingly elected an opposition candidate as mayor of Istanbul — after two decades of control by Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party, known as the A.K.P. — free elections in Turkey have always defied its authoritarian state system. Yet something about this era under Erdogan has still felt different, more lasting, as if the continuing existence of the A.K.P.’s repressive policies will permanently impair otherwise resilient, historic institutions. Mulkiye, after all, was more than just an academic faculty; it was the academic faculty that provided the Turkish state with its administrators and statesman, its legal experts and political historians. Those associated with Mulkiye not only understood how the Turkish state worked; they were, to some degree, the Turkish state. Mulkiye was established in what was then called Constantinople during the Ottoman Empire to train civil servants and diplomats. Ataturk, the founder of the modern Turkish republic, moved the school to the new capital city, Ankara, in the 1930s. This measure was both practical and symbolic: The decaying Ottoman Empire had given way to a rebellious new nation that required statesmen (like himself) who were dedicated to secularism, modernity and nationalism. Over time, Mulkiye would become not only a primary intellectual and political engine of the Turkish republic but also a center of dissent for Turks who wished to both uphold and transform it. Many of the scholars engaged in creating Turkey’s early constitutions came from Mulkiye. The legislators tasked with building the young republic were able to do so in part because, even if their political backgrounds differed, they shared some of the same republican values. Foreign ministers, governors and ambassadors often came from Mulkiye, much as French politicians commonly come out of Sciences Po. Uzgel told me that it was generally known that you were less likely to attain a position at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs unless you had a degree from Mulkiye. It was at Mulkiye, in part, that the foundations of Turkey’s foreign policy were established. In reaction to devastating wartime experiences during the 19th and early 20th centuries, the new Turkish republic’s foreign policy would be one of caution, independence and self-defense, characterized by a reluctance to meddle in foreign wars and a general orientation toward the West but without deep allegiance to a single power. As Timur Kuran, a Turkish-American professor of economics and political science at Duke University, put it to me recently, “The members of Mulkiye helped to restrain the state and helped to prevent politicians in power from using foreign policy for momentary gain.” This entwining of the government and Mulkiye intellectuals explains why they have so often been persecuted. In 1960, students so vociferously protested the changes being made to the country by Adnan Menderes, Turkey’s leader at the time, that the university was temporarily shut down. Even as Mulkiye continued to serve its function as a feeder department to the Turkish state, university campuses like Mulkiye’s came to be seen as inspiration for greater, nationwide political opposition. Throughout the ’70s and ’80s, after two military coups, many leftist Mulkiye professors were purged and even thrown in jail. But even following these dramatic events, the very Mulkiye people who suffered would eventually go back to work for the government or return to teaching jobs. In 1971, for example, a Mulkiye dean named Mumtaz Soysal was accused of making Communist propaganda and sent to jail. “I heard he cleaned toilets in prison,” one former Mulkiye professor told me. Yet 20 years later, Soysal was Turkey’s foreign minister. Over time, several aspects of Mulkiye’s influence in the state bureaucracy were diminished, especially in the realm of local administration and finance. But even after so much trauma, Mulkiye — and particularly its prominence in foreign policy and the Turkish Foreign Ministry — survived. In the 1980s, students like Ilhan Uzgel entered Mulkiye to work toward advanced degrees and stayed on as professors. By that time, a government-controlled institution called YOK, created to exert more centralized control over the universities, had been given purview over a suite of traditionally independent functions ranging from admissions testing to tenure decisions. The Mulkiye faculty split into right and left. The secularist-nationalists opposed some liberal reforms to the economy; they were critical of the Kurdish struggle and political Islam, and some were against joining the European Union. The leftists and liberals favored human rights (including for Kurds and Islamists), entry into the E.U. and broader democratization. In 1998, the Turkish military shut down the ruling Islamist political party and imposed further restrictions on political Islamists and other religious figures. Erdogan, then mayor of Istanbul, was sent to prison. By the 2000s, a more liberal-seeming, post-Islamist party led by Erdogan was ascendant. Many Mulkiye academics were so inclusive in their thinking as to have been sympathetic to Erdogan when he became prime minister in 2003. Soon after, though, something began happening behind the scenes. “Mulkiye’s ties with Turkish bureaucracy began to be cut off around 2004,” Uzgel told me. “The A.K. Party just cut it off. Their own people began to dominate the bureaucracy system.” “I grew up at Mulkiye,” Elcin Aktoprak was saying. “Inside the campus, there was a kind of freedom that didn’t exist in the rest of the country.” I met Aktoprak, Canberk Gurer and Kerem Altiparmak, all former Mulkiye academics, at their office at a European Union-funded human rights organization, which sits in a lovely central neighborhood in Ankara. They are in their 30s and 40s. Aktoprak has short, unfussy hair and the easy confidence of many female Turkish intellectuals. (She and Uzgel have divorced in the time since the purge.) She felt more comfortable at Mulkiye as a woman than in other parts of Turkey, as did many self-described feminists, gay students, Kurds and leftists. But when those at Mulkiye talk about its freedom, they are primarily referring to the liberty to criticize — not only peers but also professors and deans, the people with authority. During Aktoprak’s tenure at Mulkiye, a certain radical spirit had been reignited there, mainly in response to the so-called Kurdish issue. During Turkey’s founding, Kurds had been victims of pogroms and categorized as “mountain Turks,” rather than ethnic Kurds, and were forced to speak Turkish; the Kurdish regions in the southeastern part of the country were neglected economically. In the 1970s, a new separatist-terrorist group, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (P.K.K.), was founded by Abdullah Ocalan — himself a former student at Mulkiye — to lobby for the right to embrace Kurdishness and also to fight for separation from the Turkish state. A vicious war erupted. Turkish military forces burned down villages and tortured and killed Kurds, and the P.K.K. attacked security forces and terrorized town squares. There was — and still is — no issue in Turkey that galvanizes Turks and Kurds more than the war with the P.K.K. For many Turks, the idea of Kurdishness invalidates the central idea of the Turkish nation, which is that Turkey is a country for the Turks. In the political rhetoric of the Turkish state, to be pro-Kurdish is almost to be a terrorist yourself. By the 2000s, the early years of Erdogan’s rule, the government began engaging in a “peace process” with the P.K.K. At the same time, Kurdish students continued to flood the universities, and many were attracted to Ankara University’s legacy as a place of protest. In particular, they entered into certain faculties — communication, education, law and political science (Mulkiye) — located on the same campus. Leftist and Kurdish and pro-Kurdish-rights students enjoyed a kind of freedom there almost singular in Turkish life, which is predominantly conservative, among both the religious and the secular. For conservative students, the Cebeci campus might have seemed like one in which pro-Kurdish students somehow had more power than themselves. “More than half of the students might be nationalist or conservative,” Aktoprak said, “but the atmosphere was more leftist, giving leftist students the ability to express their views more than at any other universities, without banning other voices.” In this regard, there’s some resemblance to American universities like Berkeley and Columbia in the 1960s, but it’s important to remember that university campuses are some of the only places in Turkey where a young Kurdish leftist would be able to openly declare his politics. The rector of Ankara University and the dean of Mulkiye also saw Mulkiye’s openness as crucial to the education of its students. An episode in 2009 shows how this commitment could play out. Mulkiye’s Human Rights Center held a conference, what it called “a public civil-society dialogue,” with representatives from the European Union. Cemil Cicek, deputy prime minister of Turkey — that is, deputy to Erdogan — asked to attend. “We didn’t invite him, but we had to accept his participation,” said Kerem Altiparmak, who was head of the Human Rights Center at the time and is one of Turkey’s leading human rights lawyers. “But the night before the event, one of my students said, ‘Professor, I guess we will be protesting your event tomorrow.’ I said, O.K. I cannot decide on behalf of them. Peaceful protest is the right of students.” The next day, those students arranged themselves in plush blue seats throughout a large, auditorium-style Mulkiye lecture hall, all of them facing a dais flanked by Mulkiye insignia and photos of Ataturk. Among the attendees were the rector of Ankara University and a Mulkiye dean. Cicek rose to speak behind a wooden lectern. And then the students, one by one, stood up to interrupt him. “Can I please ask something?” one young man said, his hand raised. “In this country, people like Engin Ceber” — a human rights activist — “are taken into custody and killed by torture.” He went on: “In this kind of country, as the deputy prime minister, I don’t believe you have much to tell us.” Everyone clapped. “With these speeches and this applause, you have used your rights in the name of democracy,” Cicek said over the cries. “If it’s O.K. with you, I will now exercise my right —” “Dear minister,” another young man broke in, standing up. “This democracy and human rights forum is happening with a police blockade around it. Can you explain why?” Cicek kept talking. The young man kept talking, too. The applause grew louder. “It’s true that I came here knowing this may happen —” Cicek said. “Then how dare you come here!” one man yelled. “If you knew that, why did you come?” “There is no place for Cemil Cicek in this school!” another young man yelled, and the crowd cheered. “There is no place for people like you in a university! You have no right to speak here! You’re not here to talk about human rights!” At that point, the minister’s security guards tried to stop this man from speaking. “Is this democracy? You have 50 men trying to take me out of here!” Cicek decided to leave. The rector of the university and the Mulkiye dean politely escorted him as he exited the lecture hall. But that was it. No student was punished. No investigations followed. Academic life in Turkey has long included places like Mulkiye, where teenagers and 20-somethings learned to stand up in a crowded lecture hall and directly challenge one of the most powerful politicians in the country. Around the early 2000s, Mulkiye professors began noticing unfamiliar and suspicious developments. Government apparatchiks at state agencies started rejecting applications for research projects that would have normally been accepted. For instance, in 2009, Uzgel applied for a grant to do research in Washington on the relationship between Turkey, the United States and northern Iraq. He applied to George Washington University and to Tubitak, the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey. His application was accepted by George Washington but not by Tubitak, something that rarely happens in Turkish academic life. The attitude at these agencies, the professors said, was that because religious or conservative A.K.P. supporters had felt for decades that they had been shut out of elite academia, now it was their turn to have advantages in academia. They sometimes even said that directly to people, Uzgel heard from other academics. “It’s our turn.” In 2012, Erkan Ibis became rector of Ankara University. Ibis projected a secular lifestyle, and the professors observed that his wife didn’t wear a head scarf. He didn’t seem like a sycophantic A.K.P. type. But by this point, Turks were beginning to grasp that to remain in powerful state positions, they would have to toe the line. Those who once drank alcohol, for example, might now make a point of drinking water. University rectors who once allowed protests on campus might make a point of banning them. That fall, Ibis invited an unexpected luminary to speak at the school’s opening-day ceremony: Prime Minister Erdogan. While Erdogan often attended the opening-day ceremonies at universities close to his government, to do so at Ankara University was unusual. A group of professors within Mulkiye decided to conduct a separate opening-day ceremony for their faculty, at exactly the same time as Erdogan’s speech. They called their gathering “Freedom of Expression and the Universities” and invited speakers like Ismail Besikci, a writer and sociologist who had been imprisoned for 17 years on charges of advocating separatism. When the rector learned of the parallel ceremony, he asked a Mulkiye dean at the time, Yalcin Karatepe, to cancel it. Don’t do it on the same day, Ibis suggested; then: Don’t do it at the same hour. (Ibis disputes this claim.) “But I refused to cancel,” Karatepe told me later. “This faculty has survived six sultans, 11 presidents, countless prime ministers. Erdogan was just another one, and this time will pass. This institution has a tradition of speaking out, and we who are here now must continue the tradition.” Mulkiye’s ceremony was held in the end. The faculty’s relationship with Ankara University’s rector deteriorated, especially after the events of the following summer, in 2013. That’s when the Gezi Park protests, which began in Istanbul in reaction to the planned destruction of a park, quickly spread to Ankara and across the country, as a rejection of the A.K.P. government. It would be hard to overstate how terrifying the Gezi protests must have seemed for Erdogan. Gezi brought even the most apolitical students out into the streets. Middle-aged people joined them, too. “Normally those families would stop their kids, but they went out together; that was something quite new in Turkey,” Uzgel told me. Eventually police officers cleared Gezi Park of the protesters. Erdogan was elected president for the first time a year later in 2014. “Erdogan began his ‘one-man-ification’ of the country after Gezi,” Gurer said. “And our rector began his ‘one-man-ification’ of the university as well.” At the same time, the Gezi Park protests led to the popularity of a new political party, H.D.P., headed by the Kurdish politician Selahattin Demirtas, who was magnetic, funny and handsome. Demirtas strove to make his party open to all Turks and more independent than its predecessor parties, which had ties to the P.K.K. He urged peace with the Turkish state. His popularity soared. Erdogan seemed to feel threatened by the emergence of a politician more charismatic than he was. Soon after, he did what countless Turkish politicians before him did to win votes: He helped reignite a war in the southeast against the P.K.K., which for its part engaged enthusiastically. Antiwar protests erupted on Mulkiye’s campus throughout 2014 and 2015. Such demonstrations were to be expected of Mulkiye students — but now Ibis, the new rector, took a very different attitude toward them. According to a report produced by Baris Unlu and Ozlem Albayrak, former Mulkiye professors, 626 Ankara University students in 2015, 758 in 2016 and 815 in 2017 “were given disciplinary action.” The rector opened two investigations into Yalcin Karatepe — the same dean who allowed the alternate opening-day ceremony — including one for leaving his post without permission. (According to Turkish law, a civil servant must notify an employer of travel plans, but this is rarely enforced.) In an email, Ibis said: “If a crime is committed, you have to follow the essential legal process. Otherwise you would be taking part in a crime or working with the criminal.” He also said that during this period he believed that a “group of students had not been letting those who didn’t share the same background as themselves, or hold the same political views, enter campus and thus go to classes and tests, and that some of the academic staff had supported these activities.” Pro-government media began signaling to state authorities which political actors in Turkish life should be investigated or condemned for various infractions — a sinister trend that extended to journalists, politicians, academics and students. The newspapers Yeni Akit, Habervaktim and Vahdet hounded Mulkiye, calling the people there “enemies of Islam,” “gay lovers” and “bastards.” When Mulkiye’s Human Rights Center screened Lars von Trier’s film “Nymphomaniac” in the name of freedom of expression — the film had been banned in Turkey — critics referred to both the department and the film as sapkin, or “perverted.” This kind of invective reached a fever pitch when it came time for Mulkiye’s Inek Bayrami, or Cow Festival, a longstanding Mulkiye spring tradition in which for two days students are encouraged to criticize their professors in a public forum. (It’s essentially a roast.) One of the Cow Festival rites is the selection of an “imam” to initiate the proceedings, which include a mock opening prayer. The festival was repeatedly attacked by pro-government trolls online, and the 2017 festival was canceled by the administration. The student who played the imam in 2016 was charged with insulting religion. “Yeni Akit always said we protected L.G.B.T. students, pro-Kurdish or so-called terrorist students,” Aktoprak said. “But we only defended their rights. We were trying to protect our students from the attacks from security forces. We experienced early what everyone in Turkey is experiencing now — that even if you just support something, they label you a terrorist.” And once you are labeled a terrorist in Turkey — where the antiterror laws are elastic — your life is more or less over. Mulkiye professors defined this entire period, the Erkan Ibis era, as “mobbing,” or an attempt to force people out of their workplace through intimidation. In early 2016, some academics circulated a petition supporting a peaceful resolution to the government’s war with the P.K.K. They called themselves Academics for Peace and titled their petition “We Will Not Be Party to This Crime!” In Turkish academia, such petitions were normal, even banal, and when the academics urged their colleagues to sign it, many did so reflexively, more than 2,000 in Turkey. Professors from Mulkiye signed the petition not only out of solidarity but also because many of them were engaged in exposing the undemocratic lie at the heart of the Turkish republic — the fact that Turkey was founded as a nation of Turks only, when millions of its people were not Turks at all but Kurds. The language of the petition would someday haunt its signers: “As academics and researchers of this country, we will not be party to this crime! ... This deliberate and planned massacre is in serious violation of Turkey’s own laws and international treaties to which Turkey is a party. ... We demand the state to abandon its deliberate massacre and deportation of Kurdish and other peoples in the region. ... For this purpose we demand that independent national and international observers be given access to the region and that they be allowed to monitor and report on the incidents.” Soon after it was released, Erdogan, himself a rhetorical master of sorts, homed in on the petition’s language, in part because it seemed to suggest that he was guilty of an international crime. He responded by declaring in a speech that the academics were guilty of a national one: “The old Turkey, run by a handful of lumpen, who call themselves intellectuals and academics, doesn’t exist anymore. These lumpen circles have shown once again their true faces. With this declaration, they have shown the terror propaganda directly, which they have been conducting for years indirectly. ... Do you favor the unity and solidarity of Turkey or not? If you favor the unity of the country, why do you speak in the jargon of the terror organization, which makes our citizens’ lives miserable and attacks our security forces? This is called terror propaganda.” Across the country, academics were vilified, threatened and even arrested. According to Unlu and Albayrak’s report, Ankara University immediately opened an investigation into the academics who signed the petition. (Ibis said this was done at the request of YOK.) Around the same time, two professors, Unlu and Gokcen Alpkaya, came under attack for questions they included in their exams. Unlu had asked about Abdullah Ocalan; Alpkaya had asked about the Academics for Peace petition. A legal case brought against Unlu accused him of inciting terror. The mobbing had intensified. Ilhan Uzgel found the atmosphere so stressful and worrisome that he took a sabbatical at SOAS, in London. Before he left, the rector was discussing with professors the option of withdrawing their signature from the petition. “I said, No, I cannot do it,” Uzgel said. Among other reasons: “My assistant signed that petition. I couldn’t do that to him.” While Uzgel was away in London, there was another attempted military coup in Turkey. In response to the failed coup in 2016, Erdogan purged the state’s ministries, its police force, the military, the secondary schools, hospitals, unions, newspapers and nonprofit organizations — some 150,000 people in total. Many of the denounced were accused members of the Gulen movement, whom the government associated with the coup plot. But soon Erdogan turned on Kurds and leftists, including, of course, academics. In September 2016, along with thousands of other Turks, 21 members of the teaching staff were fired from Ankara University, including some half dozen assistants from Mulkiye. The academics at Mulkiye, Aktoprak noted, were very agitated. “Everyone, including the lawyers, started telling us what we should do,” she said. “Like, who will be the contact person for your family if you are taken into custody? What’s in your messages? What’s at your house? We all started wondering what it could be.” She looked at Gurer, sitting across from her. “Did you throw anything out?” “Magazines,” he said. “I got rid of my computer, my phone. I erased all of my WhatsApp.” The next month, in October, some of their colleagues were refused the right to leave the country. “We realized some of these people who couldn’t go abroad didn’t have a case opened against them,” Aktoprak said. “For example, one of our university colleagues was going to go to Japan, and at the gate at the airport she learned she couldn’t go. We think that the rector had sent a list to the state security forces that said, These people could be connected to terror.” (Ibis denies giving this type of information to state security forces.) Three months later, on Jan. 6, 2017, the purge struck Mulkiye again. The professors Faruk Alpkaya and Ozlem Albayrak were fired, along with professors from other faculties at the school. The remaining professors checked Resmi Gazete, the government’s official online bulletin, every day. Will I be fired today? they wondered, or will I be fired tomorrow? For a month, it was all the petition signers talked about. They knew that those already purged had lost access to certain online university systems. They checked obsessively to see if they, too, had lost access, as if this would be the tell of their impending doom. “OSYM, the national testing center that organizes university entrance exams, blocked me on Twitter,” Gurer said. “This was one month before I was fired.” “It was terrible,” Aktoprak said, laughing a little. “You would say to yourself, If a bird takes off, does it mean I’m being fired?” For this reason, Aktoprak and Gurer were almost relieved when finally, on Feb. 7, 2017, they, along with 27 other academics, lost their jobs. It was one of the last big spates of firings, and again the campus erupted in protests. The police responded with tear gas. Soon after, fired professors who tried to enter Mulkiye were turned away. “I’m sorry, hocam,” the security guards would say. “You are one of the fired.” Aktoprak found that experience so painful — to suddenly find yourself barred from a place you had found refuge every day for your entire adult life — that she never returned. The Mulkiye that remained was no longer recognizable to those who once worked there. The walls, which had always been covered with leftist posters, are now sparsely adorned with Turkish flags. The Human Rights Center was closed. (The rector has since reopened it under his control.) Certain subjects are now rarely taught — Foucault, say, or queer theory. Master’s and doctoral courses have been canceled, leaving graduate students suddenly without an adviser. The film society, where students and professors used to drink wine and watch movies together, has been shut down, and the showing of films, according to academics who have been purged, has been banned entirely. “Mulkiye always used to mean criticism,” Aktoprak said. “And it can’t mean that anymore.” The academics left at Mulkiye were shouldering an unimaginable course load, slinging enormous sacks of papers and tests over their backs to grade at night. One of the people who remained was Kerem Altiparmak. He is currently part of a group of lawyers representing about 100 Turks at the European Court of Human Rights and Turkish criminal courts who were targeted by the post-coup purge. He was not fired from Mulkiye, but he resigned last year. He no longer felt that the conditions for conducting an academic life existed there. Altiparmak found himself investigated for holding academic discussions on Turkey’s post-coup state of emergency laws. “The university sent a letter to all academics and forced them to sign it, in which the rector warned not to cross lines in the curriculum,” Altiparmak said. “It said, We receive complaints from our students that teachers are discussing subjects irrelevant to the curriculum, and I am warning you not to do this.” The universities had also empowered the more conservative students to submit complaints about their professors through something called the Communications Center of the Presidency, or Cimer. “They say things like, ‘You are now telling your Marxist opinions to us,’ ” Altiparmak said. “Some don’t want to hear other perspectives. This will affect all culture of Turkey because these are the people going into the state bureaucracy.” Similar disruptions have occurred in the Foreign Ministry as well. Selim Sazak, a Turkish Ph.D. candidate at Brown University and writer on foreign affairs, has said that an A.K.P. apparatchik discouraged him from aspiring to a big career in the foreign service, saying, “The era of people like you” — non-A.K.P.-affiliated, prep-school-educated — “is over.” In fact, it’s not a stretch to suggest that the enormous transformations in Turkey’s foreign policy right now — its engagement in the wars in Syria and Iraq, its steep increases in military spending and its distancing from the West — can be connected to the sidelining of some traditional voices, including ones from Mulkiye. “There was still an expectance of Mulkiye as a fundamental institution of the republic,” Timur Kuran of Duke University says. “Before, no one sought to eliminate it or remove the checks and balances in the political system that came from Mulkiye. In the present case, there is an effort to remove not only Mulkiye’s supervisory role but all checks and balances.” “Mulkiye-trained people tended to be much more cautious in foreign policy,” Kuran says. “Keeping the country at peace was their fundamental goal. Right now, Erdogan is taking huge risks. All checks and balances in foreign policy are disappearing, and even to raise questions about the adventures that Turkey is now getting into is to risk persecution as a traitor.” Not surprisingly, this atmosphere has prompted a brain drain — thousands of Turkish academics, in the social sciences as well as the sciences, have left the country. Even the government has acknowledged that the departures represent a full-blown crisis. Recently, the minister of industry and technology, Mustafa Varank, promised academics abroad a monthly salary of 24,000 lira (about $4,200) if they came to Turkey. Many students told newspapers they would not return to a country where they felt academics were rewarded on ideological grounds or for connections rather than merit, or where they wouldn’t be able to work on any subjects that countered the official state line. As a former professor who has remained put it to me: “There is no point in carrying on as if nothing changed. If there’s no more university life, why should I be in the university anymore?” Elcin Aktoprak and others did receive a grant from the European Union to do research and build pilot programs for online “human rights ateliers.” Many fired professors established alternative education centers in the wake of the purge, which were called “solidarity academies,” and where you could go to learn about politics in peace. “The one silver lining to all this,” Aktoprak said, “was that maybe we can sustain an intellectual community on our own this way and return to public life in better days.” For everyone, though, there is still the prospect of prison. According to Academics for Peace, more than 2,000 hearings have been held for the peace petitioners, and none have resulted in acquittals. In most cases decided so far, academics receive a 15-month suspended jail sentence, but some 30 of them have not been given suspension of judgment, and one professor, Fusun Ustel, is currently in jail. Another signatory, Tuna Altinel, is in prison on charges from a different case. Ilhan Uzgel spends most of his days working on his laptop at a Starbucks in an Ankara mall. After he was fired, he looked into jobs at private universities — which are not barred from hiring fired professors, technically — but they are all too scared to hire the purged. This was a common claim among purged professors. In at least one way, Uzgel was one of the lucky ones: He was old enough to retire and receive his pension. The loss of people like Uzgel, and as a result the loss of their analytical expertise, is an enormous loss for Turkish society. The people best able to analyze for me what was happening in Turkey in 2019 — its political scientists — were the ones being erased by what was happening in 2019. With them goes not only history itself but also nuance and complexity and fairness. As someone who has studied Turkey’s political history, Uzgel acknowledged that his fate was not entirely unusual. The tradition of purging preceded the founding of Turkey, and it continued throughout modern Turkish history. Purging was not an anomaly but rather integral to that history. “The first thing these kinds of ideological movements target are people and institutions that produce knowledge,” Uzgel said. “They have to clear those areas in order to establish their own power. Because they represent the only dissenting forces in a society. The business class does not speak up against the government. Civil society is already weak in Turkey. Universities with strong traditions are critical because they recruit younger generations. You have to break institutions. Authoritarian regimes don’t necessarily send everyone to jail.” But if the authoritarian regime lasts long enough, it can succeed in suppressing even relatively uncritical voices. Most of the Mulkiye professors did not believe that Erdogan wanted an Islamic state or a fascist one. What the A.K.P. seems to propose for Turkey’s future is a country without character — a country that can believe itself to be free as long as it does not adopt an identity that threatens the A.K.P. Institutions like Mulkiye had been one thing above all: independent in spirit and principle. Such institutions cannot exist in Erdogan’s Turkey for many, many reasons, one of which is simply that they are too distinct. Individuals, too, can become less distinct. They become fuzzy. Their voices fade. They lose their place in society, so much so that when they discover themselves again, the sweetness of it takes them by surprise. One of the many professors I interviewed was Faruk Alpkaya. Alpkaya talked about Turkish history. He was an academic — that was his job. But after 20 years of being a professor, he, like Uzgel and thousands of others, has spent the last two and a half years as a nonentity in official Turkish life. Alpkaya spoke in bursts for 10 minutes at a time, then apologized as if he had surprised himself, using a verb tense in Turkish that can imply the discovery of something previously unknown. “I’m sorry,” he would say. “I must miss speaking.” Suzy Hansen is a contributing writer for the magazine and the author of “Notes on a Foreign Country: An American Abroad in a Post-American World,” which was a finalist for the 2018 Pulitzer Prize in general nonfiction.

84,2019-05-28 17:58:53,2019,5.0,28,"Jack Ewing, Liz Alderman, Ben Dooley",A Fiat Chrysler-Renault Merger Would Put Nissan in a Bind,"When Japanese police officers surrounded Carlos Ghosn’s Gulfstream jet last November and packed him off to a Tokyo jail, they unwittingly provoked a seismic realignment of the global auto industry. Mr. Ghosn’s sudden fall set off a chain of events that, this month, prompted Renault’s chairman, Jean-Dominique Senard, and John Elkann, the Fiat Chrysler chairman, to jump on their mobile phones and entertain a crazy idea: a deal to create the world’s third-largest automaker, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions. After a flurry of phone calls and meetings between the two men over several weeks, Fiat Chrysler formally asked Renault to merge on Monday. If the deal goes forward, the combined Renault and Fiat Chrysler would elbow past General Motors in car sales and create a new challenger to Volkswagen and Toyota, the global leaders. And if Fiat Chrysler and Renault can patch up strained relations with Nissan, with which the French company has a formal alliance, the three would be de facto the biggest car manufacturer in the world by a wide margin and might force other large automakers to rethink their strategies. Whether this industry-changing behemoth ever takes shape, though, may depend on what was likely to be a tense meeting Tuesday, which will continue on Wednesday, in Tokyo between Mr. Senard and Hiroto Saikawa, the Nissan chief executive. Without Nissan, Fiat Chrysler and Renault would be a big but far less formidable competitor, heavily exposed to the lackluster European economy and lacking any significant presence in China, which has become the world’s biggest car market. But Nissan’s management has previously rejected Renault’s appeals for a closer partnership, and even a merger. Renault executives kept Mr. Saikawa in the dark about their talks with Fiat Chrysler until days before the deal was announced, according to multiple people with knowledge of the talks. The slight could only have aggravated relations already strained after Mr. Ghosn’s arrest revealed deep differences about the future course of the Renault Nissan Alliance, which also includes Mitsubishi. The Europeans were secretive because they worried that the Japanese might feel threatened and try to interfere by leaking the details to government officials or the press, according to a person with knowledge of their thinking. That was hardly a show of trust between companies that until recently were held up as a model of cross-cultural cooperation, an example of how carmakers can acquire the size and geographical breadth they need to survive while retaining their own identities. “It speaks volumes about the relationship,” said Michelle Krebs, a senior analyst at AutoTrader. “How are you going to make all this work when there are such bad feelings?” The companies say they want to continue to work together. But the lack of communication is inauspicious for an undertaking that, with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles in the mix, would be a hybrid of Japanese, American, French and Italian corporate cultures. Any two of those would be tough enough. “If you add F.C.A., there will be a power struggle,” said Yoshio Tsukuda, an auto industry analyst at the Tsukuda Mobility Research Institute. With the proposed Fiat-Renault deal in hand, Mr. Senard arrived in Tokyo this week with a lot more clout than the last time the partners met, in April. Nissan, on the other hand, is weakened after it reported less profit than Renault for the first time in a decade. But Nissan is wary of the Renault-Fiat merger, according to a person familiar with the company’s thinking. After Mr. Ghosn’s ouster on charges of financial misconduct, which he denies, Mr. Saikawa complained about what he saw as Renault’s unfair dominance of the alliance. Renault owns 43 percent of Nissan. But Mr. Saikawa argued that the Japanese company sells far more cars: 5.5 million in its last fiscal year compared with fewer than four million for Renault. With Fiat Chrysler on its side, Renault would become an even more overbearing partner. Fiat and Renault had combined sales last year of 8.7 million vehicles. And Mr. Senard and Mr. Elkann, a scion of the Agnelli family, which has controlled Fiat for more than a century, have much in common. Though Mr. Senard, 66, formerly the head of the tire maker Michelin, is Mr. Elkann’s elder by over two decades, both are products of elite European universities and speak French with each other. They have known each other for many years. There is no such bonhomie with Mr. Saikawa. The deal with Fiat Chrysler also sets up a turf battle in the United States that will be difficult for Nissan to win. Renault and Nissan largely stayed out of each other’s way in the two decades since they formed an alliance. Renault concentrated on Europe, Russia, the Middle East and Africa; Nissan focused on Asia and the United States. They bought parts together and shared the cost of developing new models, with their savings topping billions of dollars. But Fiat Chrysler and Nissan are in a war of attrition in the sagging American market, where both are heavily discounting their vehicles to get them off the lots and selling to rental fleets, which is less profitable than selling to consumers. “Previously Renault and Nissan were kind of complementary in their geographic coverage,” said Christopher Richter, an auto industry analyst at CLSA, a research firm. “Now you’ve introduced a new maker who is very big in the U.S., which is one of Nissan’s core markets, and Nissan is competitive with Chrysler in the U.S., so that’s another problem to solve.” After the arrest and ouster of Mr. Ghosn it became obvious how much the alliance depended on his personality and limitless self-confidence. By the time Mr. Senard took over in January, relations had seriously deteriorated. He tried to smooth things over, still hoping — like Mr. Ghosn — to eventually create a closer alliance, maybe even a single company. Mr. Senard spoke with Mr. Saikawa regularly, according to a person familiar with their interactions. They created a new leadership board for the Renault Nissan Alliance in March that gives equal weight to the Japanese side of the partnership. To soothe Japanese sensibilities, Mr. Senard insisted that there was no rush to revive talks about strengthening the alliance, at least until the leadership vacuum left by Mr. Ghosn was filled. Privately, Renault executives were increasingly concerned about Nissan’s flagging financial performance. Nissan had regularly contributed about 2 billion euros, or $2.2 billion, annually to the alliance. But Nissan cut its profit forecast in February, citing difficulties in the United States and Europe. Soon after the new leadership board’s first meeting in Paris in April, in which Mr. Saikawa and executives of Nissan and Mitsubishi were wined and dined at a dinner atop Renault’s flagship showroom on the Champs-Élysées, tensions flared. Mr. Senard had put together what advisers said was an informal proposal to merge with Nissan under a holding company. The plan was drafted in secret, but almost immediately leaked to the Japanese news media. Nissan angrily rebuffed the idea. Mr. Senard was taken off guard by the leaks and saw them as a serious breach of trust, according to a person with knowledge of his thinking. The leaks help explain why no one told Nissan about the talks with Fiat Chrysler. At the same time, Fiat Chrysler hoped to avoid alienating the Japanese, who were seen as essential partners. Mr. Senard and Mr. Elkann had already spoken informally about the idea of a tie-up, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. Fiat Chrysler had been more or less openly looking for a merger partner for several years, and Mr. Elkann was eager to move ahead. But the discussions accelerated in early May after Nissan issued a profit warning, a further sign of its financial distress. Speaking often by mobile phone, and with the discreet approval of the French government — which is Renault’s largest shareholder — Mr. Senard and Mr. Elkann hammered out a deal within a month. From the French perspective, linking with Fiat Chrysler presented a chance to increase Renault’s international reach. A merger would also reinforce Renault’s balance sheet, which was looking bleak because of Nissan’s flagging profits. A deal with Fiat would bring immediate cash to help weather a downturn in the European car market. Renault and Fiat Chrysler could also save billions by buying supplies and components together and sharing the cost of developing new technologies. In some respects, Nissan would be getting what it wanted, too. Mr. Senard will no longer press the idea of a merger with the Japanese automaker, according to three people with knowledge of the situation. The deal would reduce French government influence over Renault, long a sore point with the Japanese. And because the new company would be based in the Netherlands, Nissan could exercise voting rights it has been denied under French law. But for Nissan, the episode is also a lesson in being careful what you wish for. The company would be left with markedly less influence in an alliance it probably can’t survive without. “At the end of the day,” said Koji Endo, an auto analyst at SBI Securities in Japan, “I think Nissan has no choice but to say yes.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/business/fiat-chrysler-renault-nissan.html,business,The New York Times
85,2018-04-30 20:46:23,2018,4.0,30,Michael S. Schmidt,Mueller Has Dozens of Inquiries for Trump in Broad Quest on Russia Ties and Obstruction,"WASHINGTON — Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russia’s election interference, has at least four dozen questions on an exhaustive array of subjects he wants to ask President Trump to learn more about his ties to Russia and determine whether he obstructed the inquiry itself, according to a list of the questions obtained by The New York Times. [Read the questions here.] The open-ended queries appear to be an attempt to penetrate the president’s thinking, to get at the motivation behind some of his most combative Twitter posts and to examine his relationships with his family and his closest advisers. They deal chiefly with the president’s high-profile firings of the F.B.I. director and his first national security adviser, his treatment of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and a 2016 Trump Tower meeting between campaign officials and Russians offering dirt on Hillary Clinton. But they also touch on the president’s businesses; any discussions with his longtime personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, about a Moscow real estate deal; whether the president knew of any attempt by Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to set up a back channel to Russia during the transition; any contacts he had with Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime adviser who claimed to have inside information about Democratic email hackings; and what happened during Mr. Trump’s 2013 trip to Moscow for the Miss Universe pageant. Mr. Trump said on Twitter on Tuesday that it was “disgraceful” that questions the special counsel would like to ask him were publicly disclosed, and he incorrectly noted that there were no questions about collusion. The president also said collusion was a “phony” crime. The questions provide the most detailed look yet inside Mr. Mueller’s investigation, which has been shrouded in secrecy since he was appointed nearly a year ago. The majority relate to possible obstruction of justice, demonstrating how an investigation into Russia’s election meddling grew to include an examination of the president’s conduct in office. Among them are queries on any discussions Mr. Trump had about his attempts to fire Mr. Mueller himself and what the president knew about possible pardon offers to Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser. “What efforts were made to reach out to Mr. Flynn about seeking immunity or possible pardon?” Mr. Mueller planned to ask, according to questions read by the special counsel investigators to the president’s lawyers, who compiled them into a list. That document was provided to The Times by a person outside Mr. Trump’s legal team. A few questions reveal that Mr. Mueller is still investigating possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia. In one of the more tantalizing inquiries, Mr. Mueller asks what Mr. Trump knew about campaign aides, including the former chairman Paul Manafort, seeking assistance from Moscow: “What knowledge did you have of any outreach by your campaign, including by Paul Manafort, to Russia about potential assistance to the campaign?” No such outreach has been revealed publicly. Jay Sekulow, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, declined to comment. A spokesman for the special counsel’s office did not respond to a request for comment. The questions serve as a reminder of the chaotic first 15 months of the Trump presidency and the transition and campaign before that. Mr. Mueller wanted to inquire about public threats the president made, conflicting statements from Mr. Trump and White House aides, the president’s private admissions to Russian officials, a secret meeting at an island resort, WikiLeaks, salacious accusations and dramatic congressional testimony. The special counsel also sought information from the president about his relationship with Russia. Mr. Mueller would like to ask Mr. Trump whether he had any discussions during the campaign about any meetings with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and whether he spoke to others about either American sanctions against Russia or meeting with Mr. Putin. Through his questions, Mr. Mueller also tries to tease out Mr. Trump’s views on law enforcement officials and whether he sees them as independent investigators or people who should loyally protect him. For example, when the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, was fired, the White House said he broke with Justice Department policy and spoke publicly about the investigation into Mrs. Clinton’s email server. Mr. Mueller’s questions put that statement to the test. He wants to ask why, time and again, Mr. Trump expressed no concerns with whether Mr. Comey had abided by policy. Rather, in statements in private and on national television, Mr. Trump suggested that Mr. Comey was fired because of the Russia investigation. Many of the questions surround Mr. Trump’s relationship with Mr. Sessions, including the attorney general’s decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation and whether Mr. Trump told Mr. Sessions he needed him in place for protection. Mr. Mueller appears to be investigating how Mr. Trump took steps last year to fire Mr. Mueller himself. The president relented after the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, threatened to resign, an episode that the special counsel wants to ask about. “What consideration and discussions did you have regarding terminating the special counsel in June of 2017?” Mr. Mueller planned to ask, according to the list of questions. “What did you think and do in reaction to Jan. 25, 2018, story about the termination of the special counsel and Don McGahn backing you off the termination?” he planned to ask, referring to the Times article that broke the news of the confrontation. Mr. Mueller has sought for months to question the president, who has in turn expressed a desire, at times, to be interviewed, viewing it as an avenue to end the inquiry more quickly. His lawyers have been negotiating terms of an interview out of concern that their client — whose exaggerations, half-truths and outright falsehoods are well documented — could provide false statements or easily become distracted. Four people, including Mr. Flynn, have pleaded guilty to lying to investigators in the Russia inquiry. The list of questions grew out of those negotiations. In January, Mr. Trump’s lawyers gave Mr. Mueller several pages of written explanations about the president’s role in the matters the special counsel is investigating. Concerned about putting the president in legal jeopardy, his lead lawyer, John Dowd, was trying to convince Mr. Mueller he did not need to interview Mr. Trump, according to people briefed on the matter. Mr. Mueller was apparently unsatisfied. He told Mr. Dowd in early March that he needed to question the president directly to determine whether he had criminal intent when he fired Mr. Comey, the people said. But Mr. Dowd held firm, and investigators for Mr. Mueller agreed days later to share during a meeting with Mr. Dowd the questions they wanted to ask Mr. Trump. When Mr. Mueller’s team relayed the questions, their tone and detailed nature cemented Mr. Dowd’s view that the president should not sit for an interview. Despite Mr. Dowd’s misgivings, Mr. Trump remained firm in his insistence that he meet with Mr. Mueller. About a week and a half after receiving the questions, Mr. Dowd resigned, concluding that his client was ignoring his advice. Mr. Trump’s new lawyer in the investigation and his longtime confidant, Rudolph W. Giuliani, met with Mr. Mueller last week and said he was trying to determine whether the special counsel and his staff were going to be “truly objective.” Mr. Mueller’s endgame remains a mystery, even if he determines the president broke the law. A longstanding Justice Department legal finding says presidents cannot be charged with a crime while they are in office. The special counsel told Mr. Dowd in March that though the president’s conduct is under scrutiny, he is not a target of the investigation, meaning Mr. Mueller does not expect to charge him. The prospect of pardons is also among Mr. Mueller’s inquiries, and whether Mr. Trump offered them to a pair of former top aides to influence their decisions about whether to cooperate with the special counsel investigation. Mr. Dowd broached the idea with lawyers for both of the advisers, Mr. Flynn and Mr. Manafort, according to people with knowledge of the discussions. Mr. Manafort has pleaded not guilty on charges of money laundering and other financial crimes related to his work for the pro-Russia former president of Ukraine. Mr. Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general who was ousted from the White House in February 2017 amid revelations about contacts with the Russian ambassador to the United States, ultimately pleaded guilty last December to lying to federal authorities and agreed to cooperate with the special counsel. “After General Flynn resigned, what calls or efforts were made by people associated with you to reach out to General Flynn or to discuss Flynn seeking immunity or possible pardon?” Mr. Mueller planned to ask. An earlier version of this article omitted the first name of President Trump’s former national security adviser. He is Michael T. Flynn.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/30/us/politics/robert-mueller-questions-trump.html,us,The New York Times
86,2018-04-26 18:30:58,2018,4.0,26,Kiley Roache,Opinion | The Future of Frats,"On Campus Ms. Roache is a sorority member at Stanford. “Our way of life is under attack,” the keynote speaker said. The women filling the ballroom, many of them wearing a Greek letter lapel pin or a monogrammed sweater, shouted in agreement. It was the 2015 national convention for my sorority, and college administrators and national pundits alike had been deliberating the elimination of Greek life. Debates about the future of fraternities and sororities have only gotten more intense since then. One part of this discussion is about campus chapters guilty of hazing, sexual assault or intolerance. Most recently, a video emerged of fraternity members at Syracuse University making hateful vows containing racist slurs. There is no debate about what to do with a group that embraces hate like that: It should be kicked off campus, immediately (the Syracuse fraternity, Theta Tau, was permanently banished this month). But there is also a wider conversation about why fraternities and sororities continue to exist at all and what role they have at a modern university. Shouldn’t we just ban them all? I don’t think we have to. I am a firm believer that living in a house with your friends, playing beer-drinking games and dancing to overplayed pop songs are not fundamentally incompatible with inclusion, respect and a just society. And on campuses where Greek life remains, it is increasingly popular, according to the North-American Interfraternity Conference. But Greek life needs to change. In its current form, it fosters not just fun and friendship but also inequality. At a time when many dorms have gender-mixed floors, and a full generation after most single-sex schools began admitting both sexes, these organizations seem like relics. Fraternities and sororities must make a number of changes to ensure their survival, starting with going coed. Those who defend Greek life talk about how it fosters a sense of community and belonging at a time when many people are far from home and often unsure of their direction. People meet lifelong friends, and sometimes spouses, through the Greek system, and after college, alumni associations can provide networks in new cities. This may explain why people remain fierce advocates of their “way of life” long after graduation. Studies have shown that fraternity and sorority members also surpass their non-Greek counterparts on a number of metrics. They are more likely to graduate on time and go on to earn higher salaries (though joining a fraternity does seem to have a slight negative effect on grades). In addition to all that they provide their members, Greek organizations also typically raise money for charity and do volunteer work. What’s not to love? Well, a lot. Those who support Greek life often have a blind spot. The system strictly enforces gender separation and traditional gender roles. Rules that prevent sorority sisters from hosting parties, drinking alcohol or having members of the opposite sex in their houses result in a disproportionate amount of social capital concentrated in male-dominated spaces. While not all fraternities, and certainly not all fraternity men, abuse this social power, some do. This means that women may be excluded from a major social space on campus if they do not adhere to the expectations of fraternity men. This hasn’t just made it easier to exclude women; it has made it easier to objectify them, too. I would prefer no Greek life to Greek life that continues to marginalize women and other groups. The purpose of higher education is to prepare the next generation to be engaged and democratic citizens. This is why most universities, even those that are private, receive public funding. And Title IX prohibits schools that get such funding from discriminating on the basis of sex. The organizations on these campuses should be held to the same standard. Despite the perception that critics of Greek life are attacking a “way of life,” it is quite possible to preserve what is good about the organizations — fun with friends and a community based on common values — while dispelling the bad. Implicit bias training could reduce the discrimination based on race and religion that has for years influenced determinations of which prospective members were the right “fit,” and providing financial aid for the expensive dues could bring in students who would otherwise find membership unaffordable. And sororities and fraternities should go coed. Greek organizations would not be the first single-sex college group to become coeducational. The eating clubs at Princeton were forced to go coed in the ’90s and more recently, some Harvard final clubs have become open to all genders. This year at Yale, the Whiffenpoofs, an a cappella group, admitted the first female member in its 109-year history. But this change is not just about keeping up with the times. It is about resolving a division that disservices all students. Involvement in Greek life is about building deep friendships, and there is no reason those friendships should be limited by gender. Of course, there will be resistance, but this is not just about frats and sororities surviving in an increasingly diverse and open world; it’s about them living up to what they were meant to be in the first place. These communities should be based on common values and passions, not on common privileges of sexual orientation, race, religion or gender. Organizations chartered to uphold values of character, leadership and sincere friendship should not object to such a cause; in fact, they should be at its forefront.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/26/opinion/frats-college-greek-life.html,opinion,The New York Times
87,2019-01-25 10:00:48,2019,1.0,25,Marc Stein,N.B.A. Teams Are Running and Gunning. And Their Critics Are Yawning.,"The text message from his assistant coach Rex Kalamian popped up on Doc Rivers’s phone on an off night last week, but it contained no pressing strategic suggestions for the Los Angeles Clippers’ next game. No injury updates or juicy trade rumors, either. Kalamian simply felt an urgency to let Rivers know that it had happened again — another burst of the scoreboard overload that has dominated this 2018-19 N.B.A. season even more than the star-laden Golden State Warriors. A laughing Rivers recounted how Kalamian’s summary pointed out that nearly every winner that night (Jan. 14) scored 131 to 149 points. “It was like five teams up there,” Rivers said. In truth it was only four — Indiana (131), Atlanta (142), Golden State (142) and Philadelphia (149) — but Rivers’s point was made. A leaguewide push by teams to shoot more 3-pointers and take more shots earlier in the shot clock than ever before, combined with a freedom-of-movement crusade driven by the league office, has resulted in an offensive boom rendering scores in the 140s routine — with few signs of it abating. The trend has not been met with universal approval. Some of the game’s biggest names, including Gregg Popovich, Charles Barkley and Stan Van Gundy, continue to register concerns that teams are abandoning too many traditional offensive principles in favor of rampantly hoisting 3s. Top defenders like Golden State’s Draymond Green and Denver’s Paul Millsap have also charged that tighter refereeing has made it harder than ever to counter the offensive wizardry of dynamic new-age scorers like Houston’s James Harden, who rumbled for 61 points Wednesday night at Madison Square Garden to cap a five-game streak in which Harden averaged a colossal 52.2 points. The reviews, though, have generally been more positive than negative. The N.B.A.’s 30 teams are averaging 110.5 points per game collectively (up from 106.3 last season), representing the highest rate since 1984-85, when it was a 23-team league that wasn’t nearly as sophisticated in its defensive concepts and scouting techniques. “The game is the most skilled that I’ve ever seen it,” said Rivers, who played in the N.B.A. from 1983 to 1996 and has been a head coach since 1999. “I like watching the game now, so I guess that’s my answer. But it’s a different game, there’s no doubt about it.” Said Millsap, who made four All-Star appearances with Atlanta before joining the Nuggets in July 2017: “You can’t really touch guys now. So the fouls are up, 3-point shooting is definitely up. And the scoring’s up.” Millsap, though, is not convinced that those things are necessarily worrisome. “It’s fun for the fans to see,” he said. “It’s fun to see good teams get 140 points, so I’m all for it.” As recently as three seasons ago, in 2015-16, teams managed to crack the 140-point barrier only five times. That number rose to 13 last season. This season it has already happened 28 times entering Friday’s play, which coincides with the league average for 3-point attempts per game crossing the 30 threshold for the first time in league history at 31.3. The league office, however, insists that inflating scores further was not the aim when it announced that existing rules would be enforced with greater frequency this season. The rules in question forbid players to “hold, push, charge into, impede the progress of an opponent,” or take any other measures that could be interpreted as causing the player guarded to be “rerouted.” Kiki VanDeWeghe, the N.B.A.’s executive vice president for basketball operations, said the push to enforce such violations with more vigilance stemmed from longstanding team complaints about physicality away from the ball and in the post in an era when more and more coaches have favored switching defenses that call for defenders to pass players off to a nearby teammate instead of trying to fight through screens. “Those rules were always there,” VanDeWeghe said. The freedom-of-movement movement gained steam last summer when coaches like Boston’s Brad Stevens and Utah’s Quin Snyder led the lobbying against the proliferation of switching defenses creating too many opportunities, in VanDeWeghe’s words, for “holding and grabbing and physical play off the ball.” Yet that’s just one element of a cocktail that has changed the offensive equation as wildly as the N.B.A. witnessed in the 2004-5 season, when the pairing of Steve Nash and Coach Mike D’Antoni’s famed Seven Seconds or Less Offense — abetted by the league’s crackdown on hand-checking — began to revolutionize offensive philosophy. The campaign to curtail physical play was among the factors that helped transform Nash from a mere All-Star point guard to a two-time winner of the Most Valuable Player Award. The Warriors, led by their Splash Brothers backcourt of Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, then took D’Antoni’s freewheeling approach to a new level in their first championship season in 2014-15 by averaging 27.0 3-pointers and a league-high 98.3 possessions per 48 minutes. The Rockets, now coached by D’Antoni, have since made Golden State look comparatively restrained, averaging 42.3 3-point shots per game last season and 44.4 per game this season. Houston’s devotion to 3-pointers and layups, and preferably nothing in between, at the behest of their analytics-obsessed general manager, Daryl Morey, is such that Harden & Co. are attempting more 3-pointers than 2-pointers as a team for the second consecutive season. Entering Friday’s games, 19 teams were averaging at least 30 3-pointers per game, while pace is another area that has revved things up dramatically. Teams are averaging 99.5 possessions per 48 minutes this season, which is only 2.2 possessions more than last season, but consider that the Suns’ highest pace average in Nash’s peak years (97.7 possessions per 48 minutes in 2007-8) would rank 25th this season. “My first year here, we were No. 1 in the league in pace and it felt like we were running past everybody every night,” Golden State Coach Steve Kerr said. “This year I think we’re playing even faster than we did in 2014-15, but we’re middle of the pack. The whole league has shifted in terms of priority and style.” VanDeWeghe is convinced that when the competition committee reconvenes next month during All-Star Weekend in Charlotte to assess how the game is being played and officiated, there will be more praise than grumbles. “I still remain the complaint department,” VanDeWeghe said. “But most of the feedback I get is, ‘The game looks better.’ ” Kerr is among the frequent objectors despite the fact his team seemingly benefits as much as any from a free-flowing game. He contends offensive players are not punished enough on traveling calls and when pushing off on drives to the basket, which fuels Kerr’s contention that it has “never been more difficult to guard in the N.B.A. than it is right now.” “I’d like to see a balance where the rules are still geared toward these high scores, because I think a lot of people enjoy that, but you’ve got to give the defense a chance,” Kerr said. “We’re giving so much of an advantage to the offensive player.” Proponents of the 3-pointer laud its comeback potency, in terms of wiping out big deficits quickly, but there’s no dodging the fact that blowouts are on the rise. There have been 35 games already this season decided by 30 points or more — compared to just 40 total last season and a record 49 in 2016-17. “I think a lot of people, maybe in the N.B.A. office and some of the media, just equate scoring with excitement,” Stan Van Gundy, the ESPN analyst and former Miami, Orlando and Detroit coach, said on a recent NBC Sports “Habershow” podcast. “Close, competitive games, regardless of style of play, are always exciting. “I think we’re headed in the wrong direction. We’re O.K. right now. Where are we going to be in five years? Is everybody going to shoot 50 or 60 3s a game?” There has been no louder critic of the direction offenses are trending than Popovich, who routinely uses the word “boring” to describe the proliferation of shots behind the 3-point line. San Antonio’s 24.3 3-point attempts per game, which ranked last in the league, would have ranked No. 2 as recently as the 2011-12 season. “Everybody penetrates to shoot 3s, so the artfulness of the game is sort of getting lost,” Popovich said last week. “And everybody does the same thing because the analytics drives it, where shooting these 3s seems to be the smart thing to do. “So you end a game and the first stat you look at is if one team shot 3s well and the other one didn’t. Game over — you don’t have to look at rebounds, turnovers, anything else. That tells the whole tale. And that’s pretty boring.” Popovich was then asked if the Spurs’ league-low total of 3-point attempts is by strategic design, in response to the lost “artfulness,” or more a byproduct of San Antonio’s roster, which features two elite midrange scorers in LaMarcus Aldridge and DeMar DeRozan but no point guard adept at getting into the paint and collapsing defenses. “If we were able to get more 3s,” Popovich admitted grimly, “we would.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/sports/nba-scoring.html,sports,The New York Times
88,2019-06-10 16:26:23,2019,6.0,10,"James Wagner, Dionisio Soldevila",David Ortiz Is Flown to Boston After Shooting at Dominican Bar,"David Ortiz was not planning on going out Sunday night in the Dominican Republic. But a call from a friend, Jhoel López, a local television host, persuaded Ortiz to change his mind. Soon after Ortiz’s arrival at a regular hangout, the Dial Bar & Lounge, in the eastern part of Santo Domingo, an assailant crept up behind him and fired a gunshot from close range. The bullet entered Ortiz’s back and exited his abdomen, seriously wounding the former Boston Red Sox star known as Big Papi, who became one of baseball’s most respected athletes while playing a key role ending the club’s 86-year World Series drought in 2004. “We were just hanging out and going about our way,” Ortiz’s brother, Eloy, said in Spanish. “This doesn’t make sense.” While news of the shooting spread late Sunday, sending shock waves through the baseball community, Ortiz, 43, was rushed to a clinic in Santo Domingo. After spending six hours in surgery, until after 3 a.m. Monday, he was in stable enough condition to be transported to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston via an air ambulance provided by the Red Sox, club officials said on Monday afternoon. “It’s a family decision, because the last 20 years of his life have revolved around the Boston Red Sox,” Leo López, Ortiz’s longtime assistant, said in a phone interview. Ortiz’s gallbladder and part of his intestines were removed during the operation, said Abel Gonzalez, one of the doctors who operated on Ortiz at his clinic. Ortiz’s liver was also damaged. As he was wheeled into the clinic, Ortiz said, “Please don’t let me die, I’m a good man,” according to an emergency room doctor who was present. Ortiz was sedated but woke up late Monday morning and spoke briefly to his father and sister, who offered him words of support, Leo López said. “The events of last night shook our Red Sox family to its core,” Sam Kennedy, the Red Sox’s president, said at a news conference on Monday. “David Ortiz is one of the most celebrated and beloved members of the Red Sox family.” Many current and former players, including Pedro Martinez, the former Red Sox ace from the Dominican Republic, offered support on social media. On Monday, former President Barack Obama also posted a message for Ortiz on Twitter. Ortiz, who lives in Miami but spends some of the year in the Dominican Republic, had been back in his native country for about a week, promoting a new cigar brand and working with a new foundation to supply sports equipment to kids. He was also training with his 15-year-old son D’Angelo, who is hoping to follow his father’s footsteps to the major leagues. He has a wife, Tiffany, and three children. The motive for the attack remained unclear and was still under investigation, the authorities said, but they ruled out an attempted robbery. Security footage obtained from the bar by police showed Ortiz falling over and out of his chair after the shooter approached him and fired. Police detained Eddy Feliz García, 25, who was believed to be the driver of the motorcycle that fled the scene after the shooting, according to Ney Aldrin Bautista Almonte, the director of the national police. An angry mob beat the driver after the motorcycle sputtered. A second suspect has not been identified or arrested. Jhoel López, Ortiz’s friend, was also injured, possibly by the same bullet, in the leg and is in stable condition, said Leo López, Ortiz’s assistant. The shooting occurred in an area filled with high-end clubs and bars where Ortiz has been known to frequent. Leo López said Ortiz is well known at Dial. He said he did not know why Ortiz was targeted. “You know how the world is right now,” he said. “In reality, there is no respect for life by a lot of people. People can take others’ life for any difference. And it’s a difference we don’t know right now. David is a guy that is beloved, not just here but around the world.” Ortiz’s big bat and big personality earned him that affection over a 20-year major league career. The left-handed slugger spent 14 seasons with the Red Sox, where he was a 10-time All-Star and three-time World Series Champion. He famously became an outspoken voice for the city following the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013. Ortiz is much-loved in Boston for helping the Red Sox win the 2004 World Series, their first since 1918. That year, he buried the rival Yankees in the American League Championship Series with a home run to end Game 4, a single to win Game 5 and another home run in Game 7. In 2009, The New York Times reported that Ortiz had tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs six years prior, before penalties were in place and when results were supposed to remain anonymous. Ortiz acknowledged then the report was accurate and later said he had been careless in his use of over-the-counter vitamins and supplements. He said he had never used or bought steroids. He retired in 2016 with 541 home runs, 17th-most in major league history. He has raised millions of dollars through his foundation to help children’s medical needs in New England and the Dominican Republic. “It’s really sad when stuff like that happens, especially for ones that you care and you love, that are kind of part of your family,” Robinson Cano, the Mets second baseman who is also from the Dominican Republic, said on Monday. “This is really sad. So hopefully they find the guy, then find out what was really the whole situation. Hopefully this doesn’t happen to not only baseball players, but anyone.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/sports/david-ortiz-shooting.html,sports,The New York Times

A laser beam shot from one of four telescope units of the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope, one of the largest in the world. New telescopes such as the Thirty Meter Telescope and the Extremely Large Telescope would dwarf it — if they're completed.CreditCreditY. Beletsky (LCO)/ESO It is high noon, again, for astronomers who want to erect a gigantic telescope on Mauna Kea, the grand volcano on the Big Island of Hawaii. On June 21, the Supreme Court of Hawaii will hear oral arguments in Honolulu on whether to approve a building permit for the telescope, which would be the biggest and most expensive in the Northern Hemisphere. This same court rescinded the telescope’s permit two-and-a-half years ago on procedural grounds, after protests had prevented construction on the mountaintop. The Thirty Meter Telescope (named for the diameter of its main light-collecting mirror) has been 15 years in the planning. It would be one of three gargantuan telescopes now in the works that could transform astronomy in the 21st century. If they don’t get clearance to start building on Mauna Kea soon, the Thirty Meter astronomers say they will build it on La Palma in the Canary Islands, off Africa, where the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory is home to several telescopes, including the 10-meter Gran Telescopio Canarias. The Thirty Meter Telescope would be completed in 2029, if construction can start — somewhere — next year. But that’s still a big “if,” and would leave the telescope far behind its rivals in the race to enlarge the scrutiny of the heavens. The Mauna Kea drama has overshadowed other issues about the financing and future use of the next generation of extremely large telescopes, as they are generically called. Most of the groups involved, for example, have not yet raised all the money and partners required. That in itself is hardly surprising. “It takes a generation to build a telescope,” said Charles Alcock, director of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and a board member of the Giant Magellan Telescope Observatory, which is building a rival giant telescope in Chile. You can’t wait for all the money before you begin, he added; construction should start with whatever money is in hand. [Sync your calendar with the solar system. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Both the Giant Magellan and the Thirty Meter Telescope are hundreds of millions of dollars short of their funding goals, according to unofficial estimates from outside scientists. Some astronomers say the Thirty Meter Telescope, which was originally estimated to cost $1.4 billion, will now take some $2 billion to complete. Project officials themselves have declined to say how much they need. In a statement released by the Thirty Meter Telescope International Observatory, Edward Stone, a Caltech professor and executive director of the observatory, said the exact price of the telescope would depend on when and where it was built. The light-gathering ability of a telescope is determined by the area of its main, or primary, mirror. Which means that the 30-meter-class telescopes under development will be 10 times as powerful as the largest telescopes now on Earth, which have primary mirrors 10 meters across. But all this virtue costs money and groundbreaking technology. Following the model of the Keck Telescopes on Mauna Kea, the main light-gathering mirror of the Thirty Meter Telescope will be a mosaic of hundreds of smaller hexagonal mirrors put together like tiles on a bathroom floor. The Giant Magellan, by contrast, achieves its power by combining seven 8-meter-diameter mirrors. However, the Giant Magellan will start up with only four of the mirrors in place, in 2023, making it temporarily the biggest telescope on Earth. It will be eclipsed a year later by another entry in the giant telescope sweepstakes: the European Extremely Large Telescope, being built by the European Southern Observatory, also in Chile. It was originally going to be a mosaic 100 meters in diameter (formally known as the Overwhelmingly Large Telescope, or OWL); it was reduced to 42 meters in diameter and now 39. When it goes on line in 2024, it will be the largest optical telescope in the world. A sore point of both the Thirty Meter and Giant Magellan telescope projects is that neither has received much support from the National Science Foundation, which traditionally finances ground-based astronomy in the United States. There is now a proposal afoot to fix this: According to the plan, which has many bureaucratic, academic and political hoops to leap through, the National Science Foundation would contribute a quarter of the cost of each of the two telescopes in return for access to observation time for outside astronomers. Otherwise, all the telescope time would be reserved for astronomers from the institutional partners in those collaborations. David Silva, director of the National Optical Astronomy Observatory, said the idea arose last year during discussions of an upcoming survey of astronomical priorities by the National Academies of Science. Once a decade, the academy convenes a blue-ribbon panel to recommend how to spend federal dollars. The 2020 survey starts this fall, when someone is chosen to lead the main committee. Previous panels have given projects like the Hubble Space Telescope important political and financial momentum. An obvious question about the survey, Dr. Silva recalled, was what to do to boost one or both of the Giant Magellan and Thirty Meter telescopes. The two projects started up a few miles apart in Pasadena — at the Carnegie Observatories and at the California Institute of Technology, partners with the University of California — with very different ideas on how to proceed. The efforts have grown into sprawling international consortiums, intense rivals for partners and other resources since birth. “Both projects finally woke up to the fact they are being creamed by the European 39-meter,” said Matt Mountain, the president of the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, which manages the national observatory and other astronomical facilities for the government. Dr. Silva and others, most notably Dr. Mountain, concluded that the two projects would have a better chance of success if they joined forces and put forward a unified science case. “A bigger umbrella would work better,” Dr. Silva said in an interview. Without a plan, he pointed out, American astronomers were facing the looming possibility of not having access to the largest telescope on Earth — after a century of dominance with telescopes like the 200-inch on Palomar Mountain in California. The situation is reminiscent of the plight of American particle physicists, who ceded leadership in high energy physics a quarter century ago when the Superconducting Supercollider was canceled, he said. CERN then built the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland, which has been the center of physics ever since. If the Thirty Meter and Giant Magellan telescopes do not reach fruition, Dr. Silva said in an email, American astronomers could still participate in European-led projects in Chile. “But at the very least, that’s a significant psychological line to cross for U.S. astronomy,” he noted. The plan would entail identifying “key science programs,” involving subjects or exoplanets or dark energy that could be pursued with both United States telescopes in a coordinated “big data” kind of way. The national observatory would control the observing time. For now, the boards of both collaborations have bought in to the idea. “This is very much a work in progress,” Dr. Silva said. “We are in a trust-building phase. Can we work together?” Dr. Alcock said that as yet there was no firm number on how much the science foundation would contribute, but they were talking about $350 million apiece to the two telescopes. In the end, he said, they would probably get more. Representative John Culberson, Republican of Texas and chairman of a House panel that oversees financing for the National Science Foundation, recently signaled his possible support for the giant telescopes by tripling the proposed budget for the agency’s construction budget for 2019. “There should be enough room in the international community for three E.L.T.s,” Dr. Alcock said. But where they will be is still an issue. Mauna Kea, with its high altitude and calm, dark skies, is considered by some to be the natural place for a telescope like the Thirty Meter. Mauna Kea is part of so-called “ceded lands” that originally belonged to the Hawaiian Kingdom and are now administered by the state for the benefit of Hawaiians. In 1968, the University of Hawaii leased the top 11,000 acres of the mountain for a dollar a year, and began awarding subleases to various observatories for telescopes. But some environmentalists and native Hawaiian groups say the spread of observatories on the summit has polluted the mountain, interfering with traditional cultural and religious practices, or are actually infringing on the sovereignty of the Hawaiian Kingdom. In 2014, protesters broke up a groundbreaking for the Thirty Meter Telescope and then blockaded the mountain, preventing any construction. The same court that revoked the telescope’s building permit is also pondering the sublease for its site. A recent poll shows that a growing majority of Hawaiians favor building the telescope on Mauna Kea, but nobody knows what will happen or who will show up to protest when the court decides on the telescope’s permit and sublease, or when construction trucks can start going back up the mountain. The whole universe will be watching. An earlier version of this article misidentified the large telescope under construction in Chile. It is the Giant Magellan Telescope, not the Grand Magellan Telescope.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/11/science/thirty-meter-telescopes-costs.html,science,The New York Times
90,2020-03-30 05:00:25,2020,3.0,30,Julie Turkewitz,Bogotá’s Cacophony Is Hushed by Virus as Congested Streets Empty Out,"Colombia Dispatch In normal times, Colombia’s crowded capital reverberates with never-ending noise. But under quarantine, the city was overtaken by an extraordinary sound: silence. BOGOTÁ, Colombia — The typical Bogotá morning starts at dawn and quickly becomes an eight million-person roar. There is the whoosh-squoosh of the juice vendor squashing her oranges on the corner, the growl of a hundred motorbikes, the wheeze of a thousand lumbering buses. There are the salesmen barking on their bullhorns, the protesters shouting in the plaza, the drum squads and the never-ending honks and squeals of what has been called the most congested city in the world. But after Mayor Claudia López declared Colombia’s sprawling, mountainous, mural-covered capital under quarantine and ordered people to stay at home, something else arrived. Silence. Or if total silence eluded certain corners, there was at least a new soundscape, a refitted rhythm for an extraordinary time. Instead of the thunder of motors climbing into the hills, there was the scrape of plates in the neighbor’s kitchen. The clink of wind chimes. The gush of a sink. The occasional ominous scream of an ambulance. Two people making love. Tina Turner on someone’s speakers, with amateur vocal accompaniment. “What’s love got to do with it?” Outside, at night, leaves crinkled under the feet of a few solitary dog walkers. Footsteps echoed like boots after a snowfall. Like the rest of Latin America, people here for weeks had been watching at a relatively safe distance as the rest of the world convulsed amid the onslaught of the new coronavirus. But now the region is bracing to feel its full impact. Bogotá’s lockdown began on March 20. Colombia on Sunday said it had more than 700 cases, with at least 10 deaths. Cases in neighboring Ecuador now near 2,000, and in Brazil, top 4,000. With millions of people in Latin America working in the informal sector, with no guaranteed wages and no benefits, there is widespread acknowledgment that many here do not have the means to survive weeks under lockdown. And there is deep fear across the region that the associated economic and social disruption could far outlast the virus itself. As residents of Bogotá tried to digest that reality, the hush unnerved some of its more noise-hardened citizens, the strange emptiness a suggestion that something sinister was on its way. “Makes me anxious,” said Juan León, 50, a gas station attendant coming off a night shift at the pumps. He’d spent the overnight hours alone, fearful of a robbery. Others found comfort in the quiet, a welcome stillness ahead of a coming attack. “Silence in itself does not exist,” said Enmanuel Rivero, 25, a violinist in a black jacket standing with his dog, Dante, in the La Soledad neighborhood on a recent night. Mr. Rivero pointed out the rustle of the trees, “the soft whisper of the breeze.” “You hear the call of nature,” he said. The city’s lowered voice “calms me,” he added. “It reminds me of my little hometown.” The next morning, La Soledad, a middle-class neighborhood split by a normally bustling strip of greenery, was so quiet you could hear the water rushing in a nearby river. A few people in white masks waited outside the locked gates of a supermarket, friendly but nervous. Above the store, a woman stood in the window of an apartment on the fourth floor, peering down at the near empty street. “We’ll hug each other again,” said a large sign hanging in her window. On the street, an enormous two-wheeled recycling cart, like a giant’s wheelbarrow, cut the quiet. Tika-tika-tika-tika went the wheels on the asphalt. Clunk-clunk went the wagon as it hit the ground. A small man emerged from behind the cart and introduced himself as Jorge Paez, 58, a trash collector. The quarantine had been problematic for Mr. Paez, who gathers cardboard and other items and sells them to a recycler. On a good day he brings in $3, buys some food and sleeps in a shelter. But when he went to sell his cardboard recently, the recycler was closed. He had no idea how he would continue to eat. “I am at great risk because of my age, but I have to go out to make a living,” he said. He motioned to another older man on the street, shuffling along in worn clothes. “We are all at risk,” Mr. Paez said. “And we’re putting others at risk.” On another empty street, a male voice spilled onto the sidewalk from behind someone’s red door. It was Iván Duque, the president, on the television, trying to soothe the country. He was extending the quarantine to the whole nation, he said, until at least mid-April. He urged people to wash their hands “constantly,” and for now, to stop hugging their grandparents. “These pandemics,” he said gravely, “tend to grow exponentially.” Later, near dark, a hacking cough rippled through an empty park. Ack! Ack! Ack! Akchoo! “I’m good, thanks,” said the owner of the coughs, an artisan named Julio César, 60, who normally sells soap carvings in the street. “I’ve been sleeping on the street for days,” he hollered across the road, “because I have no money and no one is buying.” He coughed. “But I’m OK,” he said, coughing again. “I’m going to be OK.” The city’s silence turned out to be a fragile phenomenon. The next day, there was broad confusion over whether the citywide quarantine was still in place, and when exactly the countrywide quarantine would begin. Bogotá began to boom again. There were long lines outside grocery stores and banks, and some people crowded into buses, trying to get to work. And in the city center, at Plaza de Bolívar, home to the enormous, regal congressional building, a crowd formed, everyone packed together, some wearing masks, to express their fears about the coming days, and to demand help. “We’re hungry,” they shouted. “We’re hungry!” Updated March 24, 2020",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/world/americas/bogota-colombia-coronavirus-silence.html,world,The New York Times

92,2018-03-07 05:01:00,2018,3.0,7,Farhad Manjoo,"For Two Months, I Got My News From Print Newspapers. Here’s What I Learned.","State of the Art I first got news of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., via an alert on my watch. Even though I had turned off news notifications months ago, the biggest news still somehow finds a way to slip through. But for much of the next 24 hours after that alert, I heard almost nothing about the shooting. There was a lot I was glad to miss. For instance, I didn’t see the false claims — possibly amplified by propaganda bots — that the killer was a leftist, an anarchist, a member of ISIS and perhaps just one of multiple shooters. I missed the Fox News report tying him to Syrian resistance groups even before his name had been released. I also didn’t see the claim circulated by many news outlets (including The New York Times) as well as by Senator Bernie Sanders and other liberals on Twitter that the massacre had been the 18th school shooting of the year, which wasn’t true. Instead, the day after the shooting, a friendly person I’ve never met dropped off three newspapers at my front door. That morning, I spent maybe 40 minutes poring over the horror of the shooting and a million other things the newspapers had to tell me. Not only had I spent less time with the story than if I had followed along as it unfolded online, I was better informed, too. Because I had avoided the innocent mistakes — and the more malicious misdirection — that had pervaded the first hours after the shooting, my first experience of the news was an accurate account of the actual events of the day. This has been my life for nearly two months. In January, after the breaking-newsiest year in recent memory, I decided to travel back in time. I turned off my digital news notifications, unplugged from Twitter and other social networks, and subscribed to home delivery of three print newspapers — The Times, The Wall Street Journal and my local paper, The San Francisco Chronicle — plus a weekly newsmagazine, The Economist. I have spent most days since then getting the news mainly from print, though my self-imposed asceticism allowed for podcasts, email newsletters and long-form nonfiction (books and magazine articles). Basically, I was trying to slow-jam the news — I still wanted to be informed, but was looking to formats that prized depth and accuracy over speed. It has been life changing. Turning off the buzzing breaking-news machine I carry in my pocket was like unshackling myself from a monster who had me on speed dial, always ready to break into my day with half-baked bulletins. Now I am not just less anxious and less addicted to the news, I am more widely informed (though there are some blind spots). And I’m embarrassed about how much free time I have — in two months, I managed to read half a dozen books, took up pottery and (I think) became a more attentive husband and father. Most of all, I realized my personal role as a consumer of news in our broken digital news environment. We have spent much of the past few years discovering that the digitization of news is ruining how we collectively process information. Technology allows us to burrow into echo chambers, exacerbating misinformation and polarization and softening up society for propaganda. With artificial intelligence making audio and video as easy to fake as text, we’re entering a hall-of-mirrors dystopia, what some are calling an “information apocalypse.” And we’re all looking to the government and to Facebook for a fix. But don’t you and I also have a part to play? Getting news only from print newspapers may be extreme and probably not for everyone. But the experiment taught me several lessons about the pitfalls of digital news and how to avoid them. I distilled those lessons into three short instructions, the way the writer Michael Pollan once boiled down nutrition advice: Get news. Not too quickly. Avoid social. I know what you’re thinking: Listening to a Times writer extol the virtues of print is like taking breakfast suggestions from Count Chocula. You may also wonder if I am preaching to the choir; doesn’t everyone reading this story already appreciate print? Probably not. The Times has about 3.6 million paying subscribers, but about three-quarters of them pay for just the digital version. During the 2016 election, fewer than 3 percent of Americans cited print as their most important source of campaign news; for people under 30, print was their least important source. I’m nearly 40, but I’m no different. Though I have closely followed the news since I was a kid, I always liked my news on a screen, available at the touch of a button. Even with this experiment, I found much to hate about print. The pages are too big, the type too small, the ink too messy, and compared with a smartphone, a newspaper is more of a hassle to consult on the go. Print also presents a narrower mix of ideas than you find online. You can’t get BuzzFeed or Complex or Slate in print. In California, you can’t even get The Washington Post in print. And print is expensive. Outside New York, after introductory discounts, seven-day home delivery of The Times will set you back $81 a month. In a year, that’s about the price of Apple’s best iPhone. What do you get for all that dough? News. That sounds obvious until you try it — and you realize how much of what you get online isn’t quite news, and more like a never-ending stream of commentary, one that does more to distort your understanding of the world than illuminate it. I noticed this first with the deal Democrats made to end the government shutdown late in January. On the Jan. 23 front pages, the deal was presented straight: “Shutdown Ends, Setting Up Clash Over ‘Dreamers,’” ran The Times’s headline on the news story, which appeared alongside an analysis piece that presented the political calculations surrounding the deal. Many of the opinions in that analysis could be found on Twitter and Facebook. What was different was the emphasis. Online, commentary preceded facts. If you were following the shutdown on social networks, you most likely would have seen lots of politicians and pundits taking stock of the deal before seeing details of the actual news. This is common online. On social networks, every news story comes to you predigested. People don’t just post stories — they post their takes on stories, often quoting key parts of a story to underscore how it proves them right, so readers are never required to delve into the story to come up with their own view. There’s nothing wrong with getting lots of shades of opinion. And reading just the paper can be a lonely experience; there were many times I felt in the dark about what the online hordes thought about the news. Still, the prominence of commentary over news online and on cable news feels backward, and dangerously so. It is exactly our fealty to the crowd — to what other people are saying about the news, rather than the news itself — that makes us susceptible to misinformation. It’s been clear that breaking news has been broken since at least 2013, when a wild week of conspiracy theories followed the Boston Marathon bombing. As I argued then, technology had caused the break. Real life is slow; it takes professionals time to figure out what happened, and how it fits into context. Technology is fast. Smartphones and social networks are giving us facts about the news much faster than we can make sense of them, letting speculation and misinformation fill the gap. It has only gotten worse. As news organizations evolved to a digital landscape dominated by apps and social platforms, they felt more pressure to push news out faster. Now, after something breaks, we’re all buzzed with the alert, often before most of the facts are in. So you’re driven online not just to find out what happened, but really to figure it out. This was the surprise blessing of the newspaper. I was getting news a day old, but in the delay between when the news happened and when it showed up on my front door, hundreds of experienced professionals had done the hard work for me. Now I was left with the simple, disconnected and ritualistic experience of reading the news, mostly free from the cognitive load of wondering whether the thing I was reading was possibly a blatant lie. Another surprise was a sensation of time slowing down. One weird aspect of the past few years is how a “tornado of news-making has scrambled Americans’ grasp of time and memory,” as my colleague Matt Flegenheimer put it last year. By providing a daily digest of the news, the newspaper alleviates this sense. Sure, there’s still a lot of news — but when you read it once a day, the world feels contained and comprehensible rather than a blur of headlines lost on a phone’s lock screen. You don’t need to read a print newspaper to get this; you can create your own news ritual by looking at a news app once a day, or reading morning newsletters like those from Axios, or listening to a daily news podcast. What’s important is choosing a medium that highlights deep stories over quickly breaking ones. And, more important, you can turn off news notifications. They distract and feed into a constant sense of fragmentary paranoia about the world. They are also unnecessary. If something really big happens, you will find out. This is the most important rule of all. After reading newspapers for a few weeks, I began to see it wasn’t newspapers that were so great, but social media that was so bad. Just about every problem we battle in understanding the news today — and every one we will battle tomorrow — is exacerbated by plugging into the social-media herd. The built-in incentives on Twitter and Facebook reward speed over depth, hot takes over facts and seasoned propagandists over well-meaning analyzers of news. You don’t have to read a print newspaper to get a better relationship with the news. But, for goodness’ sake, please stop getting your news mainly from Twitter and Facebook. In the long run, you and everyone else will be better off.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/07/technology/two-months-news-newspapers.html,technology,The New York Times

If you’re interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox. President Trump called the hosts of “Fox and Friends” on Thursday morning. Before he lit into a nearly unbroken 30-minute monologue, they asked him what he’d gotten for his wife, Melania, who was celebrating her birthday. He admitted that he hadn’t bought her a present, but got her “a beautiful card.” “How did Trump mess up the world’s easiest question?” — TREVOR NOAH “This is the question you don’t lie about?” — JAMES CORDEN “You’re a billionaire! You got your wife a card? Do you know what she puts up with? I think she’s earned a shopping spree — I’m going to say around $130,000 worth.” — STEPHEN COLBERT Trump suggested that his wife’s birthday was the reason for the call, which Noah said sounded like a non sequitur at best. “Why did Trump say he called into ‘Fox and Friends’ because it was Melania’s birthday? What does that mean? He’s like, ‘Honey, I’ve got a great celebration planned for us today: I’m going to talk to some TV people while sitting on the toilet.’ ‘Oh, thank you, Donald. My life is a beautiful dream.’” — TREVOR NOAH Spoiler: Kim Jong-un might not be acting entirely in good faith. As Noah pointed out, Chinese scientists say Kim’s main nuclear testing facility seems to have collapsed — putting his meeting on Friday with the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, in a new light. “Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! So part of the deal Kim Jong-un is making is to give up the test site that he already destroyed? I didn’t realize that ‘Art of the Deal’ was translated into Korean. That’s a slick move.” — TREVOR NOAH Kanye West tweeted this week that he and Trump both possess a certain special essence: “dragon energy.” Seth Meyers begs to differ. “I’m sorry, but Donald Trump does not have ‘dragon energy’ — unless you mean draggin’-his-fat-ass-around-the-golf-course energy.” — SETH MEYERS Meyers, like other hosts, spent a lot of time on Trump’s “Fox and Friends” call. Trump said his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, was representing him in his dealings with the pornographic-film actress Stephanie Clifford — which, Myers noted, seemed to undermine steps his legal team had taken to maintain the ambiguity of Cohen’s work for the president. “Man, you picture prosecutors digging for evidence. Now all they need is a remote control. I bet this morning one of them said, ‘Hey, should I print out the brief?’ and another one said, ‘No, let’s hold off, he’s on TV, I’ll bet he’s going to say something’” — SETH MEYERS Vice’s Desus and Mero responded to this week’s Twitter lovefest between Trump and Kanye West. “Brazilian locksmith?” We’ll be back on Tuesday morning with much more.

94,2019-06-28 19:54:07,2019,6.0,28,Erica L. Green,DeVos Repeals Obama-Era Rule Cracking Down on For-Profit Colleges,"Education Secretary Betsy DeVos on Friday officially repealed an Obama-era regulation that sought to crack down on for-profit colleges and universities that produced graduates with no meaningful job prospects and mountains of student debt they could not hope to repay. The so-called gainful employment rule was issued by the Obama administration in 2014, right before huge for-profit chains collapsed, leaving students stranded with debt and worthless degrees. Under the new standards, career and certificate programs, many of which operate in the for-profit sector, would have to prove their graduates could find gainful employment to maintain access to federal financial aid. It also would have required schools to disclose in advertisements a comparison of the student debt load of their graduates and their career earnings. In her first two years in office, Ms. DeVos has delayed critical parts of the rule, and last year, she sought to repeal it entirely, siding with for-profit industry leaders and congressional conservatives who have contended that the Obama administration unfairly targeted for-profit schools. Education Department officials have argued that transparency, not regulation, is the best way to hold all schools — public nonprofits, community colleges and for-profits — accountable for their results. Instead of any accountability measures, it promised to expand an existing database, called the College Scorecard, to provide information on student debt and earnings prospects. The database, which provides information, including loan debt information, for 2,100 certificate granting programs, was unveiled last month. On Friday, Ms. DeVos said that the scorecard was “only the beginning.” “These important reforms are a more complete and effective way to hold all types of higher education institutions accountable and make sure that students have a full suite of data when making a decision about their education,” she said in a statement. “This administration will continue to put students first and make sure they not only have a multitude of pathways to success post-high school but also the information they need to make the best choices for themselves.” But in rescinding the rule, the department is eradicating the most fearsome accountability measure — the loss of federal aid — for schools that promise to furnish students with specific career skills but fail to prepare them for the job market, leaving taxpayers on the hook to pay back their loans. Congressional Democrats and student advocates said rescinding the rule would leave the scandal-scarred for-profit college industry unchecked. The repeal will take effect July 2020. The department estimated that repealing the rule would cost $6.2 billion over 10 years, which includes funding grants and loans to students attending schools that would have been cut off from federal funding under the Obama rule. “Repealing — rather than revising or replacing — the gainful employment rule will prop up low-quality for-profit colleges at the expense of students and taxpayers,” said Representative Robert C. Scott of Virginia, the chairman of the House education panel. “Today’s announcement underscores the need for Congress to pass a comprehensive reauthorization of the Higher Education Act that protects students and taxpayers from low quality for-profit schools.” Bob Shireman, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation and an architect of the rule when he was in the Obama administration, called the repeal “disturbing and shortsighted.” “They are opening the door to operators whose singular focus on gobbling up federal grants and loans for their investors will steer the business toward manipulative recruiting and poor quality training,” he said. The Obama administration began drafting the regulations when the for-profit college sector was booming, with large chains enrolling 500,000 students at a time. But it was seen as a crucial safeguard against predatory colleges after the collapse of ITT Tech and Corinthian Colleges beginning in 2015. The Obama administration also tried to channel loan relief to graduates who were defrauded by their colleges. Ms. DeVos has moved to overhaul that “borrower-defense” rule as well, hoping to give some students only partial relief. That process has been tied up in court proceedings, leaving more than 150,000 student claims in limbo. One part of the gainful employment rule that had already been put into place has identified hundreds of failing programs, many of which went on to close after they were measured against the new standards. In the Education Department’s first assessment of debt-to-earnings ratios for college graduates, about 98 percent of programs that failed to meet standards for earning power were for-profits. An analysis included in the department’s final rule also shows that for-profits continued to have a significantly higher failure rate. But the department argued in its final rule that the debt-to-earnings formula created by the Obama administration was “fundamentally flawed” and did not account for factors other than the quality of an education that could affect students’ earning potential. The department also said that the rule did not properly account for other kinds of programs that have poor career outcomes and high debt, such as some liberal arts degrees. For-profit leaders have said that although the Obama rule was never fully enforced, its intent already shut down the worst-performing schools in their sector. Since 2010, when the Obama administration began deliberating the rules, more than 2,000 for-profit and career programs — nearly half — have closed, and the industry’s student population has dropped by more than 1.6 million. “The U.S. Department of Education’s final decision commits our nation’s entire higher education system to full transparency,” said Steve Gunderson, the president of Career Education Colleges and Universities, the for-profit trade group. “Instead of picking and choosing winners and losers in higher education, the department will make available, in a student-friendly and transparent manner, key data points at a program level for all programs at all schools.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/28/us/politics/betsy-devos-for-profit-colleges.html,us,The New York Times
95,2019-12-11 02:00:18,2019,12.0,11,"Matt Apuzzo, Selam Gebrekidan","Who Keeps Europe’s Farm Billions Flowing? Often, Those Who Benefit","Conflict-of-interest rules are uneven. Influence-peddling is murky. The enormous E.U. subsidy program is built to keep the money moving. BRUSSELS — One morning this spring, lawmakers crowded into a committee room filled with staffers, lobbyists and environmentalists to vote on a flurry of bills that would set the course for the European Union’s $65-billion-a-year farm policy. For critics of the subsidy system, one item was of special interest. It was known as the “Babis Amendment,” after Andrej Babis, the billionaire agriculturalist and prime minister of the Czech Republic. It was designed to prohibit politicians who hand out European Union farm subsidies from receiving the funds themselves. Mr. Babis is Exhibit A of how the system benefits the wealthy and connected. His government shapes agricultural subsidy policies in the Czech Republic. It also gave $42 million in European subsidies last year to his domestic companies, according to a New York Times analysis. His holdings in Germany, Hungary and Slovakia received another $7 million. “The vote is open,” the agricultural committee chairman declared. Eleven seconds passed. Then the chairman simply said: “Rejected.” Nobody read the proposal aloud. There was no debate. And nobody mentioned one relevant fact: that half of the 46 committee members had ties to the farm industry. Several lawmakers received thousands of dollars in subsidies. The Babis Amendment could have jeopardized their money, too. The European Union’s farm program is one of the largest subsidy schemes in the world. It represents 40 percent of the European budget — money that is meant to support farmers and sustain rural communities. Yet it is opaque in key areas, with gaping shortcomings in accountability. In November, a New York Times investigation revealed that the subsidies underwrite oligarchs, mobsters and far-right populists. The Times also showed that some national leaders use the money to enrich friends, political allies and family members. Such abuses succeed in part because of a system in Brussels that favors those who earn the most from the subsidies. Not only do they play an outsized role in setting policies, they also benefit from murky conflict-of-interest rules, weak lobbying-disclosure laws and a haphazard accountability system in which cases can drag on for years even when outright fraud is discovered. Agricultural lobbyists, among the most influential in Europe, have exclusive, closed-door access to government leaders. Conflict-of-interest laws do not apply to the ministers who vote on legislation. And members of the European Parliament are not prohibited from writing the laws for the very subsidies they receive. “The powerful people who have land and the powerful people in government work together,” said Maria Noichl, a German member of the European Parliament who sponsored the Babis Amendment. “They both benefit from the program, and most people don’t know how it works.” Renewing the seven-year farm bill is one of the top priorities on the European agenda. Debate will intensify next year when the European Parliament and council consider whether to grant national leaders like Mr. Babis greater flexibility over how the money is spent. Internal auditors have criticized that proposal, only to face lambasting in the Parliament. For years, European leaders have been warned that the subsidies encourage corruption, harm the environment and underwrite land-grabbing. Yet major change remains difficult when so many lobbyists, lawmakers and farm officials want to keep the system intact. Andrej Babis became prime minister of the Czech Republic promising to run the state like a business. But he is often accused of running the state as if it were his business. After the end of the Cold War, Mr. Babis was among the former communists who bought up what remained of the old order. He built his empire through a relentless acquisition of farms, fertilizer companies, tractor suppliers and silos. In an industry dominated by big players, his company, Agrofert, is the biggest. “I made it from nothing,” Mr. Babis said in an interview in New York. But his companies also have benefited from policies approved by governments that he has led or served in, prompting years of investigations over conflicts of interest, even as Agrofert continued to collect subsidies. When Mr. Babis was finance minister and deputy prime minister from 2014 to 2017, small farmers complained that they lost influence on a board that monitors and helps guide national policies for handing out farm subsidies. “So you can imagine what kind of a decision process takes place there,” said Jan Stefl, a 59-year-old Czech farmer. “It always favors the big farmers.” Journalists then revealed that Mr. Babis had created a shell company that collected $2 million in European agricultural grants intended for small businesses. In 2017, European investigators and the Czech police recommended that he be prosecuted for fraud. But soon after that recommendation, Mr. Babis was elected prime minister. Prosecutors said they would review the investigative file. Two years later, they dropped the case. Last week, they reopened it. That is common because European fraud investigators must work with local authorities to conduct most investigations. They can recommend charges but cannot file those charges themselves. And national prosecutors act on those recommendations only 36 percent of the time, officials said this year. “We are doing everything from our part,” a European Union spokeswoman, Mina Andreeva, said. “We’re not here to replace every single government in the E.U.” A European prosecutor’s office is being created next year to take up such cases, though some countries opted not to participate. That includes Hungary, where the prime minister’s family and friends have reaped millions in farm subsidies. In the Czech Republic, Mr. Babis has benefited from national laws that channel more European money to his companies. One rule that purports to limit runaway subsidy spending has instead created clear advantages for his company. The rule limits farmers to one grant application a year. But a company like Agrofert, which has at least 100 domestic subsidiaries, can apply many times. Mr. Babis said in the interview that he had nothing to do with those rule changes. He said the Czech government, regardless of political party, had for years supported large-scale farming. The European Union introduced stricter conflict-of-interest rules last year, but it is still unclear whether they cover heads of government like Mr. Babis. When a Czech politician asked for clarification last year, Europe’s top budget official replied that the answer required “a case-by-case analysis.” Using a Czech conflict-of-interest law, though, European investigators audited grants paid to Mr. Babis’s business this year. They found that even though Mr. Babis had put Agrofert into two trusts, he still controlled the company and therefore violated Czech law. The auditors ordered the Czech government to return all the money paid to Agrofert from European regional development and social funds, according to a leaked report obtained by the Czech news organization Denik N and shared with The Times. Mr. Babis said that he intended to return to Agrofert once he is out of office. So, if Agrofert benefits from his government’s policies, he ultimately stands to profit. But he assailed the audits, calling them “an attack on the Czech Republic” and labeling their authors incompetent. The appeals process is expected to take months. In the meantime, Mr. Babis is scheduled to join other elected national leaders on the European Council, which will meet in secret to set the European Union budget in the coming months. Czech opposition leaders have called for Mr. Babis to be excluded from that vote. One senator, Lukas Wagenknecht, urged European officials to stop paying “an East-European oligarch to establish a nondemocratic autocracy.” Mr. Babis is confident that he will be exonerated. “Nobody can corrupt me,” he said. “I’m quite a rich guy.” The defeat of the Babis Amendment barely registered with the most important lobbyists in the room. They had their eyes on the bigger picture: keeping the subsidy system intact, with as much money as possible. As long as there has been farm money, Copa-Cogeca, Europe’s largest organization for farmers, has swayed where it goes. European leaders have historically treated the group not as mere recipients of government money, but as partners in policymaking. Much has changed in recent decades: Environmental concerns have become a priority and farming has shrunk to 1 percent of Europe’s economy. Yet even today, Copa-Cogeca enjoys special access that would make others swoon. “On the subsidies, they are more powerful than anyone,” said Gérard Choplin, an agricultural policy expert and former lobbyist. Before meetings of European farm ministers, for example, the council president grants a private audience to Copa-Cogeca. That lets farm lobbyists — and only farm lobbyists — make their views heard before key decisions are made. When environmental groups requested similar access last year, they were rebuffed. A council representative told them that Copa’s meeting was a matter of tradition, “to facilitate an exchange of information.” Lobbyists are not required to register in Brussels and the capital is filled with events bringing them together with policymakers. Staff members from Copa-Cogeca, the agricultural company Bayer and the European Commission formed a group called the Young Food Policy Network, which hosts happy hours for government and business officials. This is not lobbying, staffers said, just people having drinks. Copa-Cogeca draws its influence largely from the national farm unions, which can cause political headaches. This year in France, farmers blockaded roads and dumped tons of manure outside the office of a member of Parliament in a protest over a trade deal. Copa-Cogeca officials make no apologies for being advocates for their industry. They say farmers are expected to hold down food prices, keep quality high and fight climate change — all while dealing with a panoply of regulations and a shrinking farm budget. They say they have accepted years of reforms but will not accept anything that hurts the industry’s bottom line. “We cannot be green if we are in the red,” Pekka Pesonen, the group’s secretary general, said this year. Lawmakers hear that message often. Lobbyists in Brussels are free to roam the committee room floor, and Ms. Noichl of Germany said she hesitated to talk to her colleagues there. “There’s too many people listening,” she said. Soon after defeating the Babis Amendment, the committee prepared to vote on the full subsidy bill. It gave leaders like Mr. Babis new spending flexibility. Most important, it declared that the subsidy budget should not be cut. Before opening the vote, the committee chairman, Czeslaw Siekierski of Poland, paused for a reminder. “European farmers are watching us very closely,” he told his colleagues. “And we must make sure that we can deliver.” The vote passed. To many, Mr. Babis has become a symbol of conflict-of-interest in the subsidy system. But lesser-known government officials also have a stake in the policies they vote on. Among the lawmakers who killed the Babis Amendment were Mairead McGuinness of Ireland, whose family received $28,000 in subsidies last year; Peter Jahr of Germany, who received $15,600; and John Stuart Agnew of Britain, who disclosed receiving between $13,000 and $66,000 from a company that is paid subsidies. Lawmakers said they saw no problem with their vote. Ms. McGuinness said the bill would have unfairly punished farmers whose family members entered politics. Mr. Jahr noted that all lawmakers are affected by some laws, like taxes. “To a certain extent, it is inherent to the system,” he said. If the European Parliament disagrees, nobody is saying so. Its conflict-of-interest rule is vague and leaders have taken no position on whether members can vote on and receive subsidies. The responsibility for identifying conflicts, a Parliament spokeswoman said, “lies primarily with the member.” So reports about lawmakers receiving subsidies become background noise. “They vote on the money, and they and their families get the money,” Ms. Noichl said. And the members of another governing body, the Council of the European Union, are not subject to a conflict-of-interest policy at all. It comprises ministers from all 28 countries, who vote on legislation. Members of the Council are presumed to be representing their national governments, not themselves. This means that Mr. Babis’ farm minister, Miroslav Toman, can vote on subsidy policy even though his brother and father run an agricultural company that was among the biggest Czech subsidy recipients last year. “Everyone has a stake in keeping the status quo,” said Alan Matthews, a farm policy expert at Trinity College Dublin. Experts agree that one way to curtail abuses and address inequities would be to limit how much each person receives. Another would be to reconsider a formula that pays farmers based on how much land they hold. Franz Fischler, a former European agricultural commissioner, said he had tried more than 15 years ago to accomplish both. But Britain, where aristocrats own huge tracts of land, opposed the idea, Mr. Fischler said. So did Germany, home to large Soviet-style farms in what was once East Germany. When his proposal died, Mr. Fischler warned that as the European Union expanded, the subsidies would widen the gap between rich and poor. “This is exactly where we are now,” he said. Even today, 23 of the 28 agricultural ministers who will vote on the farm bill have said they oppose a cap. “There is no real change,” said Ms. Noichl, the German lawmaker. “Not in Europe. In Europe it’s always the same.” The European Union can and does claw back misspent money. But veteran investigators ruefully joke that often the only penalty for stealing is having to return the money. For example, European investigators say they unraveled a scheme involving a Brussels-based company that received millions of dollars to promote Bulgarian agricultural products. The firm colluded with Bulgarian companies, inflated invoices and laundered money through shell companies, according to documents and current and former officials. The authorities identified a European official, Georgios Malliaris, who received cash from the scheme, according to the officials. Mr. Malliaris did not respond to repeated messages. Investigators recommended charges two years ago against the companies and Mr. Malliaris. European officials are working to recover the money from Bulgaria, but the authorities have not prosecuted any of the companies. A sealed criminal case against Mr. Malliaris and others is winding through the Belgian judicial system, current and former officials said. Until that case is resolved, European Union officials cannot take action against Mr. Malliaris. So he remains employed and has been moved to an archiving job.

96,2019-09-02 00:29:56,2019,9.0,2,"Kirk Semple, Elisabeth Malkin, Frances Robles","Hurricane Dorian Batters Bahamas, Killing at Least 5: ‘a Historic Tragedy’","MIAMI — Hurricane Dorian, one of the most powerful Atlantic storms on record, hung over the Bahamas on Monday, thrashing the archipelago with high winds and surging seawater that flooded neighborhoods, submerged vehicles and shredded homes. The storm has left at least five people dead, officials said. With the storm expected to churn a menacing path toward the United States, forecasters warned that it could inflict serious damage from Florida to southeastern Virginia and possibly beyond. Forecasters moved the storm’s much-watched “cone of uncertainty” slightly eastward on Monday, but they emphasized that even a minor change could bring the storm onto the American coast. The island of Grand Bahama was subjected to a particularly brutal pummeling as the hurricane came to a near-standstill for most of the day, spewing sustained winds as high as 180 miles per hour. [Follow the latest updates on Hurricane Dorian.] “We are in the midst of a historic tragedy in parts of the northern Bahamas,” Prime Minister Hubert A. Minnis said at a news conference late Monday afternoon. “Our mission and focus now is search, rescue and recovery. I ask for your prayers for those in affected areas and for our first responders.” On the Abaco Islands, to the east of Grand Bahama, thousands of homes were believed to be damaged or destroyed. The prime minister said the five deaths happened on those islands, which were mauled by Dorian over the weekend, and were still being lashed by the storm’s outer bands on Monday. [At a remove from the Bahamas’ resorts, the Abaco Islands felt the storm’s wrath.] Officials said it was too early to fully assess the damage because wind and rain were making it difficult to reach many of the smaller islands. The United States Coast Guard deployed helicopters and by Monday afternoon had landed in Marsh Harbour, Abaco’s main town, to conduct rescues, a spokesman said. Dorian hit Grand Bahama late Sunday as a Category 5 hurricane. It was downgraded on Monday morning by the National Hurricane Center in Miami to Category 4, and by early Tuesday morning it had weakened to a Category 3. Forecasters described it as “extremely dangerous.” Dorian’s menace lay in the slowness of its passage: Its heavy rains had more time to produce flooding, its winds more time to batter and weaken structures. As it traveled west, it slowed to just one mile an hour, and then slowed further, pummeling the islands from a near standstill. “We are afraid to even think of what those people on those islands went through with the storm slowing down and almost stopped for that amount of time, and being such a strong storm,” said Geoffrey Greene, the chief meteorological officer at the Bahamas Department of Meteorology. “We did evacuate most of the keys around Abaco and Grand Bahama,” Mr. Greene said. “But there are a few people who refuse to leave. So we’ll have to look and make sure everybody is secure if they stayed.” Caribbean disaster response managers said that they might not be able to send teams to Abaco and Grand Bahama until Wednesday, when the hurricane conditions were forecast to ease. “It will delay any ability to get into these two islands and to collect specific information on the level of impact,” Ronald Jackson, the executive director of the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency, said at a news conference. With phone, internet and power lines down in many places, communication with the islands was difficult and firsthand accounts from eyewitnesses rare. [Stories of survival in the Bahamas from Hurricane Dorian] Still, officials were able to gather enough information to make grim assessments. “Initial reports from Abaco is that the devastation is unprecedented and extensive,” said Mr. Minnis, the prime minister. “They are deeply worrying. The images and videos we are seeing are heartbreaking.” Sune Bulow, head of the emergency operation center of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said his group anticipated widespread demand for shelter, economic support, clean water and health care. As many as 13,000 houses may have been severely damaged or destroyed and that flooding on the Abaco Islands is believed to have contaminated wells with saltwater, according to the International Red Cross. Michael Scott, chairman of the government-owned Grand Lucayan Resort and Casino on Grand Bahama, called the storm “apocalyptic” and “a truly cataclysmic event.” His beachfront hotel, he reported, was operating as a refuge because many of the structures that were originally designated as shelters in Freeport, the island’s main city, were damaged. Throughout the day on Monday, rescue teams brought in families seeking sanctuary in the hotel’s ballrooms, convention center and guest rooms. “It’s catastrophic and horrible,” Mr. Scott said, “and we’re trying to ensure that people are able to exist with some degree of comfort.” One resident of Great Abaco island posted a harrowing video on Monday showing water gushing along a roadway and extensive damage inside apartments. She said the storm had pried the roof off her building. “Please pray for us,” she said. “We’re stuck right here. My baby’s only 4 months old.” Another video that circulated widely on social media captured the storm surge heaving against the windows of the flooded home of the Bahama’s agriculture and marine resources minister, Michael Pintard. Mapping the hurricane’s strength, storm surge and expected path. “That’s the water hitting my front-room window, which is extremely high,” Mr. Pintard narrates as he pans the camera around his home. “That’s my kitchen window: That water is hitting and that has to be a minimum of about 20 feet off the ground.” In a telephone interview, Mr. Pintard said that he, his wife and his daughter were trapped in the attic, looking out over the roof-high waters that had swept over their neighborhood. A couple of rescue attempts had failed to reach him, he said. But he was more concerned about his neighbors in single-story houses. “I know that it was dire for them,” he said. People climbed as high as they could and broadcast pleas for help over WhatsApp chat groups so that friends and relatives might contact the authorities. In one of those appeals, a woman gives her name and address: “I need help. Me and my six grandchildren and my son we are in the ceiling,” she said, the quaver in her voice betraying her fear. “All the neighbors and everybody are in the ceiling. Can somebody please come and rescue us please. Everybody is in the ceiling and the water is rising fast.” Sarah Kirkby, a resident of Freeport, said that people were waiting for the wind and rain to ease so that they could try to pluck people off their roofs by jet ski. Relatives and friends of people who had remained on the islands scoured social media and news sites, trying to sift through rumors in search of solid information. “Checking on Capt. Plug and Debbie and family? Any news?” wrote Sean Fletcher to the Facebook page of a volunteer fire and rescue unit in Hope Town, a settlement on Elbow Cay, an islet in the Abaco Islands. “I’m trying to reach my brother, Pherrol Duncombe, the chef at the Harbour Lodge,” wrote Ohemaa Tamara. “If you have any information please let me know.” There were nuggets of good news amid the fear and worry. “PRAISE GOD!” exclaimed Karen Huff-Lowe in a post to the Facebook page of the Hope Town Bulletin Group. “I just got confirmation my family, Robert, Mercedes, Bessie and Maity are all O.K. They think everyone else on the island is too but communication limited.” The Bahamas, a country that has long prided itself on withstanding powerful storms, revamped its building codes in the early 2000s, adopting some of the most stringent resiliency standards in the region. But Dorian’s slow pace, high winds and heavy rainfall, combined with the low-lying islands’ vulnerability to flooding, raised fears of huge losses. “We saw what a Category 5 hurricane did in Dominica and the British Virgin Islands — that was Irma and Maria,” said Mr. Jackson of the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency. “So we are looking at a situation where we have a similar Category 5, a very powerful storm, a large storm, this time sitting for much longer than Maria sat on these countries.” “We are seeing surge and high tide mixing in with rainfall to essentially deluge these islands,” he said. “We can safely say it is likely to be catastrophic.” As the storm carved up the Bahamas on Monday, it was creating anxiety across a large swath of the United States. Even if Dorian does not reach the Florida coast, strong winds are all but certain to disrupt life in the region. Gusts up to 57 m.p.h. were expected to reach parts of South Florida overnight. And much of Florida’s eastern coast is also susceptible to storm surges. The storm was predicted to move “dangerously close” to the Georgia and South Carolina coasts on Wednesday night and Thursday, according to the National Hurricane Center. Gov. Brian P. Kemp of Georgia declared a state of emergency in 12 coastal counties, and ordered a mandatory evacuation for counties east of Interstate 95. In South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster ordered the evacuation of residents in parts of eight counties on Monday. “We know that we cannot make everybody happy, but we believe that we can keep everyone alive,” he said. North Carolina’s governor also declared a state of emergency. State officials warned that heavy rain could cause life-threatening flooding between Wednesday night and Friday and that there was a possibility of tornadoes. In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis has warned coastal residents for days they should expect to lose power. On Monday, as the hurricane’s outer rain bands raked South Florida, Palm Beach, a barrier island in a mandatory evacuation zone, felt eerily calm. Roads were empty and businesses were closed and shuttered. A small crowd gathered along the beach, staring in awe at the wild gray waves crashing onto the shore. “I just wanted to take a look at this — it’s crazy,” said Brandon Atkinson, 40, a West Palm Beach resident. “You admire it for the beauty but know its devastation.” Some South Florida residents had begun moving into shelters as rain began pelting the region. By Monday morning, the West Boynton Park and Recreation Center in Lake Worth, Fla., was already home to 75 people and 114 animals, including 75 dogs, 28 cats and several birds and rabbits. A sign posted outside warned that no livestock, reptiles or vicious dogs would be accepted.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/02/world/americas/hurricane-dorian-bahamas.html,world,The New York Times
97,2019-08-20 05:00:20,2019,8.0,20,Kim Severson,It’s Not Always Excellent to Be Jamie Oliver,"Twenty years after he vaulted to fame, the brash British chef, TV star and cookbook author has lost his restaurant empire — but not his taste for hard work. LONDON — Just before lunch on a recent Monday, Jamie Oliver wrapped an apron around his dad bod and started mashing mint and broad beans with a mortar and pestle, which has long been his favorite kitchen tool. That adorable mop of hair he had 20 years ago when he slid down a banister and splashed into popular food culture as the Naked Chef is cropped now. At 44, Mr. Oliver comes off more like a pleasant, world-weary high school teacher than the arrogant jokey bloke everyone wanted to hang around with back when he blew up food TV. And are those bags under his blue eyes? “Sorry, darling,” he said as he seasoned a fillet of Dover sole. “I’m a bit tired.” The day started before 6 a.m. He dropped the kids at school, then made his way to the refurbished North London warehouse that serves as his headquarters. After feeding a reporter lunch, he had to meet top officials from Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham and London who were coming by the office to hammer out a plan to halve childhood obesity rates by 2030. It didn’t help that he and his wife, Juliette, who goes by Jools, had exhausted themselves over the weekend moving into a $7.2 million 16th-century Tudor mansion not far from his parents’ pub in Essex. (They’re keeping the eight-bedroom North London townhouse.) Granted, that kind of move is a little different from asking your friends to help you muscle a mattress into a studio walk-up. Still, moving is moving, especially with five children, including a feverish 3-year-old who spent the night “jumping around me like a rattlesnake,” Mr. Oliver said. It wasn’t just a bad night’s sleep, a new house and a packed day that weighed on him. “I have probably been pushed to the edge of my capacity over the last four years,” he said. In May, the Jamie Oliver Restaurant Group went into administration, a form of bankruptcy protection. The company, according to some accounts, owed creditors nearly 83 million pounds, or about $100 million. Mr. Oliver said he tried his hardest to keep the business alive. But after closing some restaurants, injecting the equivalent of more than $15 million of his own money into the company and searching for a new investor, he gave up. In all, he shuttered or sold 25 restaurants, putting more than 1,000 people out of work. Closing his first restaurant, the fashionable Fifteen in London, hurt the most. He had opened it in 2002 to train unemployed young people, many from difficult backgrounds, how to prepare tasting menus, make fresh pasta and run a proper dining room. “That was the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do,” he said of the closing. “Just terrible. Awful.” It would be easy to see a touch of Icarus in Mr. Oliver, or to view his saga as some sort of life lesson from an overachiever. But it’s too soon for deep reflection, and that’s not really his strong suit. Mr. Oliver is, by most accounts, an optimist and, by his own account, what the Brits call a grafter — someone who just puts his head down and works, whatever the circumstance. That’s what has gotten him this far. “I always graft it,” he said. “I put the effort in.” Mr. Oliver learned that hustle early, growing up in the Cricketers, the pub his parents still own in the village of Clavering. “I was ducking. I was diving. I was washing cars, washing toilets,” he recalled. He was a lousy student, but he knew his way around a kitchen, so he went to culinary school. He was a sous-chef at the River Café in London when a BBC crew showed up to shoot a documentary. A smart producer saw how much the camera loved him. “The Naked Chef” debuted in 1999 on BBC Two in Britain, and a year later on Food Network in the United States. The camera work was shaky, and his style kinetic. Mr. Oliver froze up when speaking directly to the camera, so producers hung just off to the side and asked him questions. By current digital standards, the show looks like something your brother the aspirational cook might shoot on his iPhone. But back then, it felt fresh, unscripted and sexy. Mr. Oliver whipped around town on a motor scooter (which now sits in front of his headquarters) and slid down a spiral banister to let friends into his East End flat to help him cook. He stuck his fingers into limes and lamb, and tossed every salad with his hands. He ushered a generation of young men into the kitchen, and taught them expressions like pukka (excellent) and lovely jubbly (also excellent). Mr. Oliver secured an endorsement deal with Sainsbury’s, the second-largest supermarket chain in Britain, that would last 11 years and earn him close to $12 million. He wrote a best-selling cookbook. It was a lot for someone in his early 20s. In 2008, he opened his first Jamie’s Italian restaurant with help from his mentor, the Italian chef Gennaro Contaldo. The idea was to disrupt mid-market dining. The meat had an animal-welfare pedigree. Butter was organic. Wages were decent and prices affordable. The restaurants were packed from the get-go. He started other chains, including Barbecoa, a pair of upscale steak and barbecue restaurants, in partnership with the American chef Adam Perry Lang. At his peak, Mr. Oliver served 7.5 million meals a year and employed 4,500 people. It’s rarely one thing that brings a big enterprise down, and Mr. Oliver was battling several dragons at once. Taxes and the cost of ingredients he favored went up. So did rent, especially in fast-gentrifying neighborhoods. But he kept expanding, sometimes into neighborhoods without enough traffic. Casual dining had become a lucrative draw for investors, and the market flooded with competitors. People started using delivery apps instead of eating out. After the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union in 2016, the value of the pound fell. Retail spending plummeted. Critics began to complain about his restaurants’ food and service. Things were no longer looking so pukka. “If you’re not bendy like this pasta, then you break,” he said as rolled out sheets for the ravioli he was stuffing for lunch. “And that’s what happened.” Friends wondered if he was spread too thin, or not paying enough attention. Others suggested he shouldn’t have hired his brother-in-law, Paul Hunt, a flamboyant former stock trader, as the chief executive. (Mr. Oliver said he needed to put someone he trusted in charge.) Or, perhaps, he simply is not as good at business as he is at cooking and campaigning to help children eat healthier. “Probably I was too trusting, which is one of my problems and also one of my benefits,” said Mr. Oliver, who estimated that he screws up about 40 percent of his business ventures. “There’s no way to sugarcoat it,” he said. “I thought I could fix it, but I couldn’t. I can absolutely look at myself in the mirror knowing I tried everything to the last very minute. We ran out of money. It’s as simple as that.” Although he still has plenty of fans, there are, and always have been, detractors. They deride his accent as “mockney,” and hold him responsible for new school-lunch rules that banished foods like Turkey Twizzlers (essentially meat curly fries). They call him a hypocrite for his $6 million deal to sell healthy-ish Oliver-branded food at Shell gas stations despite his crusade against climate change. When his empire collapsed, the tabloids were particularly brutal. “There is something in the British psyche that sort of quite enjoys the discomfiture of successful people,” said the food writer Nigella Lawson. “You get laughed at in this country for wanting the world to be a better place.” It is hard, she said, for someone who attained so much fame so young to navigate the business world. “It’s nice to have some good things said about him because he’s had such a hard time lately,” she said. “I have no doubt he will turn it around.” In many ways, Mr. Oliver is relieved to be out of the restaurant business. His empire is smaller now, with about 120 employees. He spends most of his day doing the things he loves: cooking, talking about cooking, producing content about cooking and trying to make the world a healthier place to eat. Mr. Oliver’s other ventures still make plenty of money. He has sold a lifetime total of 27 million pieces of Tefal cookware, and it’s easy to find his kitchen gadgets on Amazon. He recently signed a deal to become the health ambassador for Tesco, Britain’s largest grocery chain. Mr. Oliver’s preternatural ability to connect with an audience has helped him make the leap to digital content while other food media stars from his litter have struggled to fit content made for television onto platforms like YouTube. He mostly stays off Twitter — “it’s not a platform that makes me a happier person” — but he crushes Instagram, where he has 7.3 million followers. His YouTube channel, Jamie Oliver’s Food Tube, has 4.4 million subscribers. His average monthly social media reach is more than 30 million followers, and his global TV audience is 67 million, said Saskia Wirth, head of communications for the Jamie Oliver Group. Matt Duckor, vice president of video programming for Bon Appétit, says Mr. Oliver has a natural appeal that crosses generations. “People 18 to 34 know who he is, and people over 50 know who he is. That’s very rare,” Mr. Duckor said. “In a way, there is this nostalgia play to it, but there is this sense that this guy is closer to the ground and closer to reality than a lot of his contemporaries.” That’s one reason Bon Appétit focused on Mr. Oliver’s Insanity Burger in a segment of its new online series, “Reverse Engineering.” Chris Morocco, an editor with exceptional tasting skills, is blindfolded and must identify a dish only through taste, touch and smell, then try to recreate it. The 25-minute video featuring Mr. Oliver’s burger has been viewed 2.3 million times. Books, however, remain the engine of the Oliver machine: He has sold more than 45 million of them — $7.4 million worth just last year, according to Nielsen Book Research — and is the country’s best-selling nonfiction author. For a time, only J.K. Rowling outsold him. Mr. Oliver, who has dyslexia and what he says is an unusually short attention span, likes to dictate his books rather than type them. His topics swing with the times. He has veered from comfort foods to superfoods. He has produced 30-minute meals and 15-minute meals and five-ingredient meals. He has written recipes for squash mac and cheese for a family cookbook and, in 2018, interpreted dishes he learned from Italian nonnas. His latest is “Veg: Easy & Delicious Meals for Everyone.” An edition for the American market (retitled “Ultimate Veg”) will come out in January. He brushes off criticism that his books are derivative. “No one has a copyright on five ingredients or 30-minute meals,” he said. He can be just as riled by people who accuse him of cultural appropriation for the way he adapts recipes. He has taken flak from Spaniards for putting chorizo in paella; from Jamaicans for spicing microwaveable, packaged rice with ginger and jalapeños and calling it Punchy Jerk Rice; and from West Africans for using parsley and a lemon wedge in jollof. “I like parsley, and if I want to put it in my jollof, I will,” he said. “No one’s invented nothing unless they’ve invented sun and rain, and they ain’t.” Dishes evolve, impacted by trade, war, famine and a hundred other forces, he said. “You’ve got the Brits getting passionate about fish and chips right now, then they get really upset when you say, ‘You know it’s a Portuguese Jewish dish in the first place,’” he said. “If you want to get back to really original British cooking, it’s thistle and cabbage.” Through all the turmoil, his marriage has stayed solid, he said. The couple plan to renew their vows on their 20th anniversary next June. Mr. Oliver still wears the necklace Jools gave him early in their relationship that reads, “I love you always,” and he writes her love notes on paper towels. She is pushing for a sixth child, although he’s not so sure. Not that he doesn’t love being a father. He calls himself “an exceptional under-11-year-old dad” but perhaps only an “above average teenager dad.” “Apparently, I’m a bit barky,” he said. “I didn’t know how it felt to get achievement in education, but I knew how it felt to have tired feet and blistered hands from working,” he added. “So this means I am completely unprepared for two teenage girls that do care about learning and who do try at school.” His oldest, Poppy, will be the first Oliver to attend college. “This,” he said, “is a big moment for us.” And then there is the mission. Next to his family, doing his part to fix the food system matters to him the most. His list of campaigns, which he has waged with television shows and documentaries and all manner of political pressure, is long. Among them are improving school food, bettering conditions for chickens, reducing food waste, helping to pass a tax on sugary drinks, and his latest, curtailing ads for fatty, sugary foods aimed at children. His Ministry of Food, an eight-week community cooking course now in its 11th year, has trained nearly 100,000 people to prepare healthier food. His new North Star is the 2030 Project, an effort to coordinate health and governmental organizations in a campaign to halve childhood obesity by 2030, and it’s hard for him to stop talking about it. That’s why the gaggle of government officials who shuffled by the test kitchen an hour earlier were still waiting for him to finish up lunch. He waved off his communications director, who had been gently trying to cut him off. He had a few last points to make. “If I’m being reflective, I’ve had the best and the worst of it,” he said. “I’ve learned a lot. I smell differently now. I see differently now. It doesn’t mean I’m cynical. I still feel I have 20 years of good work ahead of me, but I don’t have an appetite to sort of see my name all over the globe in restaurants.” He just wants people to be able to eat better, no matter what their economic situation. And who better to take on such an impossible task? “You don’t want someone who’s had success after success after success,” he said. “You want someone like me.” Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest.

98,2018-03-02 05:03:31,2018,3.0,2,Joanne Kaufman,When Your Home Has a History,"18 Photos View Slide Show › When a co-op at the Hotel Des Artistes on West 67th Street became available almost seven years ago, Pamela Johnson and her husband grabbed it up. The one-bedroom duplex “wasn’t large, but it was lovely,” said Ms. Johnson, an anthropologist. The space had double-height windows, a terrace and greenhouse. But it also had quite a history as Ms. Johnson learned when the purchase neared completion — Rudolph Valentino lived there in the early 1920s. The silent film star known as the Latin Lover got himself into a bind when he injudiciously tied the knot: Even though the divorce from his first wife, the actress Jean Acker, had yet to be finalized, Valentino went and married Natacha Rambova, a costume designer. Cue the bigamy trial. Cue the breathless, scandalized newspaper coverage. (All this while he was living in what is now Ms. Johnson’s apartment.) Because the New York area has long been rich in high-profile residents it probably wouldn’t be much of a surprise to learn that the property you’re about to buy or rent was once the home of a celebrity (or perhaps a boldface name simply slept there.) Real estate brokers often try to gin up interest in a listing by mentioning, and mentioning again, the previous residents or the big-deal event that occurred on site. And maybe the “touched by greatness” aspect of the deal is what goaded you to sign the lease or the deed in the first place. But there’s a particular thrill about discovering your home’s storied history after you take possession, something akin to stumbling on a hidden room. “It gives you bragging rights at a party and may help when it comes time to sell,” said Jonathan Miller, the president of the real estate appraisal firm Miller Samuel. “But I don’t see it as a market driver. It’s more of a marketing tool.” One intriguing feature of the apartment at Hotel des Artistes had escaped the notice of Ms. Johnson on her pre-purchase visits to the Upper West Side building. But before moving out, the seller led her upstairs and pointed to the back of a closet where there was a narrow framed slit closed off by a square of painted plywood. During Valentino’s residency, the skinny opening (a mere 15 inches) was a door to the neighboring apartment that allowed Rambova, reportedly staying down the block with her aunt, to come and go undetected. “I don’t know who lived next door at the time or how Natacha got access to that apartment, but she was able to go straight through into Valentino’s bedroom,” Ms. Johnson said. Did Washington Irving Sleep Here? The bronze plaque with the words “This house was once the home of Washington Irving” had always intrigued Dan Critchett when he walked past 122 East 17th Street (it has the alternate address 49 Irving Place), a three-story brick Italianate-style townhouse and former single-family residence that has been cut up into rental apartments. Four years ago, an alcove studio on the parlor floor became available, “and I thought it was cool,” said Mr. Critchett, 61, a real estate agent at Stribling and Associates. “I thought, ‘This is a historic house and it will be something fun to tell my friends.’ ” Something fun, sure, but, as it turned out, pure fiction. The author of “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow” and “Rip Van Winkle” apparently never crossed the threshold, according to a New York Times Streetscapes column from 1994 with the headline: “The ‘Washington Irving’ House; Why the Legend of Irving Place Is but a Myth.” Mr. Critchett doesn’t know how long the plaque has been affixed to the building; who put it there is another mystery. But after settling in, he learned that he had plenty to dine out on without an assist from the creator of the headless horseman. The townhouse had once been the residence of Elsie de Wolfe, often called America’s first interior decorator, and her companion, Elisabeth Marbury, a literary agent and theater producer whose clients included Oscar Wilde and George Bernard Shaw. And there is reason to believe that Sarah Bernhardt, the architect Stanford White and assorted Astors, Morgans and Vanderbilts, might have turned up at the couple’s Sunday salons. “I’m getting a lot of mileage telling people about the house,” said Mr. Critchett, who lives in what was once the de Wolfe-Marbury living room. Learning of a house’s past can turn residents into amateur historians and scholars. Ms. Johnson, for instance, began hunting for pictures of Rambova and Valentino, unearthing several of the pair doing the tango, and is planning an evening of Valentino movies for residents at the Hotel des Artistes some time next year. For his part, Mr. Critchett read “Ladies and Not-So-Gentle Women” a group biography of, among others, de Wolfe and Marbury, as well as de Wolfe’s design book “The House in Good Taste.” “There was a chapter on this house because it was her home,” Mr. Critchett said. “My sofa is where her writing table was. She looked out the same windows I look out. And I imagine people of that era arriving for grand dinner parties here and looking at Elsie’s décor.” Home to an Impresario and a Social Activist Jessica and Robert Nacheman are, “old home people,” said Ms. Nacheman, 63, a lawyer. When they bought a wood-fronted townhouse at 312 East 53rd Street in 2012, they knew it had a past — after all it was built in 1866 — but weren’t clear on the specifics. But as they began making plans for the property’s restoration, they learned that Lincoln Kirstein, the founder, with George Balanchine, of New York City Ballet, had lived there in the 1920s and that the society hostess, artist and social activist Muriel Draper lived there in the 1930s. “I think a historical perspective on a house and a recognition of previous residents can bring a property to life,” Ms. Nacheman said. “You see the house through the people who once lived there and who live there now. It’s like time-lapse photography.” Ms. Nacheman said she did wonder if Balanchine ever came over to visit Kirstein, then realized that the men’s association began after Kirstein left the house. “My husband and I are interested in ballet,” she said, “but I don’t think knowing that Kirstein lived there made us more interested. We didn’t run out and buy a season subscription.” But Muriel Draper was another thing. “I find the thought of her more interesting than Lincoln Kirstein maybe doing some pirouettes in the living room,” Ms. Nacheman said. “She would often have famous people over and they would sit in the parlor and have discussions. That’s fascinating to me.” Fascination of a different kind would characterize Ms. Nacheman’s reaction to Draper’s sense of style. “I’ve seen one or two pictures of how Muriel decorated the house,” Ms. Nacheman said. “And I just think to myself, ‘If she saw it now, thank God, she wouldn’t recognize it.’ Partying With Mr. Showmanship When she was a little girl, Karen Grava recalls, she watched “The Liberace Show” with her grandmother “because my grandmother loved Liberace,” said Ms. Grava, the director of media relations at the University of New Haven who — sorry, Granny — was decidedly lukewarm about the flamboyant pianist. Fast forward to 2003 when Ms. Grava and her husband, Robert Luby, a retired accountant, bought a renovated 1924 neocolonial house in Wallingford, Conn. Some time after the couple moved in, Ms. Grava was standing in the front yard when the former town clerk happened by. The property had been the site of many famous parties, she told Ms. Grava, and Liberace had played at one of them. That’s because a previous owner of the house, one Thomas E. Conheady, also owned a local tavern that presented famous performers of the day. While Ms. Grava does own a few candelabras (though none as elaborate as those beloved by the man known as “Mr. Showmanship”), she has no Liberace records and — bank on it — no plans to buy any. Still, “I think it makes my husband and me feel proud to live here,” she said. “If we ever do put the property on the market, we’ll definitely mention it to prospective buyers. It’s an intriguing fact, and it adds character to the house.” In the Presence of Lady Day Arnold Steinhardt was the first violinist of the famed Guarneri String Quartet from its founding in 1964 until its dissolution in 2009, and the group frequently rehearsed in the expansive living room of Mr. Steinhardt’s apartment on the Upper West Side. “I often thought that if the walls could talk and play back some of the wonderful music by Mozart and Beethoven and Bartok and Schumann what a wonderful thing it would be,” said Mr. Steinhardt, 80, a professor at Bard College, the Colburn School and the Curtis Institute of Music. “But of course it’s a fantasy. The walls can’t talk.” Oh, but they can. They can. Two and a half years ago, Nan Newton, a Steinhardt family friend, and her husband, Dave Grusin, a pianist and composer, had dinner with Lorraine Feather, a jazz singer and lyricist with whom Mr. Grusin had just finished a recording project. It was a first meeting for the two women, and Ms. Newton was interested to learn that Ms. Feather, a longtime resident of the West Coast, had spent her early years in New York. Oh, really, where? On the Upper West Side. Where? On 106th and Riverside. Well, what a coincidence: Ms. Newton had good friends who lived on 106th and Riverside. What building? 340 Riverside. Amazing. That’s just where her friends the Steinhardts live. What apartment? 11A. “And Nan almost fell off her chair because that’s our apartment,” Mr. Steinhardt recalled. An animated email exchange between current and past resident ensued, and Ms. Feather was invited over for a visit. “She stood in the foyer and said, ‘Oh, my gosh, what went ON in this living room.’” “And I said, ‘WHAT went on in this living room?’” Mr. Steinhardt said. Ms. Feather began to tell of jam sessions with Dizzy Gillespie and Bobby Short, and of her godmother Billie Holiday performing several numbers there in November of 1956, a week after her two sold-out “Lady Sings the Blues” concerts at Carnegie Hall — and 15 years before Mr. Steinhardt and his wife, Dorothea von Haeften, moved into the building. “I said, ‘Billie Holiday sang in OUR living room?’ You can imagine what a strange and wonderful feeling it was,” Mr. Steinhardt said. But wait, there was more. Ms. Feather mentioned that her father, the jazz critic Leonard Feather, had made recordings of the sessions, and offered to send Mr. Steinhardt a link. Yes, please. “My wife and I sat in our living room and listened to Billie Holiday singing in our living room,” he said. “ ‘Good Morning, Heartache,’ ‘Miss Brown to You.’ I mean it was surreal. When I think about it I get goose bumps.” Mr. Steinhardt and his wife courted to Billie Holiday, he said. “I tell my students: If you want a great pianist who communicates something special, it’s Arthur Rubinstein; a great cellist, Pablo Casals,” he continued. “But if you want to know about great art and communication in jazz, it’s Billie Holiday because when she sings, she’s singing about the meaning of life, basically.” After 47 years, the Steinhardts are moving to Santa Fe; the prospective residents of 11A, which is now in contract, won’t be at all surprised about what happened in the living room on a special fall night in 1956. Lady Day’s concertizing was played up in the listing, and, according to Dan Douglas, a Corcoran Group associate broker, it was the story of that special night that drew the new owners to take a look at the apartment in the first place. Mr. Steinhardt couldn’t be more pleased. “I feel the same way about my apartment as I do about my 1785 violin that was made by a Cremonese master,” he said. “I wanted it to go to someone who would appreciate it.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/02/realestate/when-your-home-has-a-history.html,realestate,The New York Times
99,2020-03-19 06:01:09,2020,3.0,19,Jason Horowitz,"My Life on Italy’s Coronavirus Frontlines, and in Quarantine","Italy Dispatch I rushed back from a family ski trip to report on the sudden outbreak across North Italy. It was the last time I would touch my kids for a month. I had to cover Italy’s coronavirus outbreak. All I had was a ski mask. On the afternoon of Feb. 23, I was driving with my family and a photographer to the Italian Alps for an assignment about the impact of global warming, and for some days of vacation in a ski lodge. The kids giddily noticed patches of white snow. I made reservations at a fondue spot. The phone rang. An editor told me the number of coronavirus infections in the northern Italian region of Lombardy had erupted to 150 cases. I had to get to the area around Milan as soon as possible. As I drove the few remaining miles to drop my family off at the lodge, I alternated between apologizing to my wife, Claudia, and asking her to read out loud Italian news reports. Outside the lodge it was incredibly quiet and white. As Claudia checked in, and the photographer waited anxiously in the car, I dug through the luggage, and grabbed some essentials. I kissed my family goodbye and left them under the Matterhorn. It was the last time I’d touch them for a month. Speeding south for hours, I typed the names of the closest centers of infection into Google Maps. I spelled the town of Casalpusterlengo wrong over and over. It got dark and desperation set in. Then, I noticed it, flashing off an approaching highway exit like Gatsby’s green light. It was the blue siren of a police checkpoint. We had reached the outbreak. That initial cluster of cases has since spread across Italy, infecting tens of thousands, killing thousands and keeping a population of 60 million people essentially in lockdown. So far, I’ve been lucky. I am not sick. My family in Rome is not sick either. Friends and family back in the United States or around Europe check in with me, asking how we’re doing. They sign off “Stay safe” — the “Sincerely” of the coronavirus age. But in some notes I detect a hint of appeal, a search for insights and instructions from my experience reporting on the front line of a crisis that is coming to them. Our editors in London immediately got us a supply of masks and hand sanitizer and over the next dozen days, as the crisis intensified and fear spread across Italy, the photographer Andrea Mantovani, my Rome bureau colleague Emma Bubola and I reported across the Lombardy region. For much of it I was dressed for a ski trip. [Analysis: The world feared China over coronavirus. Now the tables have turned.] After listening to old men blithely tell us about how their buddies slipped out of quarantine over old country roads to join them for a drink, I returned to Milan. There, I went to a mostly shuttered Chinatown, where my favorite dumpling place had a sign reading “Donate to China.” I bumped into a friend there coming back from work. He recognized me despite my mask and shook my hand. He invited me over for a plate of pasta and a glass of wine but I told him better next time. We parted and he went home to his new baby. A few minutes later I frantically wrote him insisting he wash his hands. Throughout the hectic days up north, I ricocheted between extreme caution — wearing the masks, washing my hands like Lady Macbeth — and letting my guard down. Milan was emptied out, but those who remained lived life like normal. Complacency is also contagious and hardly anyone wore masks. Sometimes the three of us reporting on the crisis did wear masks. Sometimes we didn’t. Sometimes we sat at a table together. And sometimes we sat anxious and apart, like three solitary dental hygienists. The photo gallery of my phone echoed the dissonance. Pictures I took of a child waving to me from behind the quarantined lines of the Red Zone sat in a tile next to pictures Claudia sent me of my two kids, Luca and Elena, making snow angels or skiing down their first bunny slope. Calamity and normalcy rubbed shoulders, just as did the regions with and without the mass infections. Officials didn’t exactly give a clear message of how to behave. On the 36th floor of the Lombardy region’s government offices, I listened to aides to the regional president, Attilio Fontana, tell me that the mask the photographer was wearing was useless as she took Mr. Fontana’s portrait in front of vast views of the Milan cityscape. At the end of my interview with Mr. Fontana, during which I apologized for my ski clothes, I shook his hand and left. Two days later, he was on Facebook, clumsily putting a mask over his face after one of his close aides had tested positive for coronavirus. The regional leader didn’t have the virus, but the time Andrea and I had spent in his office alarmed our editors. We called the company’s health consultants, who told us the risk was minimal and we could continue working. But there was another variable. My children’s school had sent out a letter requiring the reporting “of any travel within the immediate family” during the recent week off to hot spots including Casalpusterlengo, which I now could spell all too well. Cas-al-pus-ter-lengo. I said it with spite. If I came right home to Rome, there was no way the school would let my children back into class. On March 4, the government temporarily bailed me out by canceling schools across the country, but I developed a slight cough, which, along with the incident with Lombardy’s president, led the health consultants to suggest two weeks of preventive quarantine. When I checked out of the Milan hotel, the receptionist told a colleague to close off my floor. I had been the only guest on it. For my quarantine in Rome, I picked an Airbnb down the block from my home. The apartment had a small balcony — about the size of a Twister mat — off the bedroom above an internal courtyard. It looked onto pastel Art Nouveau apartment buildings, two lamp posts and parked cars. Behind me, if I craned my neck, I could see a slice of the Aurelian Walls. At night, dogs barked and circling seagulls sounded like crying babies. I unpacked a bag my wife had assembled and pulled out the copy of “Crime and Punishment” that I had asked her to put in and that I had been meaning to read for 25 years. She also slipped in an exercise mat and a deflated exercise ball. I promptly inflated it — potentially with the coronavirus — and found YouTube clips of trainers screaming “Get it!” Things started well. On Friday morning, I buzzed in Claudia and the children into the building’s courtyard. They could not come into the apartment, so from the balcony above, I made bad wherefore art thou jokes and, in the absence of school, asked the kids, at a safe distance below, about their ski lessons back at the Matterhorn. Luca asked me to read to him. All I had was Dostoyevsky’s novel. “He had been in an irritable and tense state, resembling hypochondria,” I read. “He was so immersed in himself and had isolated himself so much from everyone.” It was topical. After a bit they got bored and started talking among themselves. I stood on my balcony, feeling like Scrooge being taught a lesson by the Ghost of Quarantine Present, allowed to observe but not engage. On Sunday at 2 a.m., my third day of quarantine, I watched Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announce that he would restrict movement in the north of Italy. I put aside “Crime and Punishment.” The exercise mat became something to step over. I gave up on “Get it.” The next weeks became a blur as Italy descended into a crisis not seen since the Second World War. After chasing the virus around the north I’d now have to report — with the help of my colleagues — from a single room, my computer perched on a bedroom vanity. I took short breaks when my family stopped by, dropping off olives or eggs on the doorstep. (“Away,” Elena said, shooing me back.) In the light rain, I looked down on the kids spinning umbrellas. In the sun, they dribbled a basketball and shot it at the wall. Once, while I waited for a virologist to call me back, we played “Red Light, Green Light 1, 2, 3” with me turning around on the balcony and them running toward a wall in the courtyard. From the street, I looked like a masked American madman screaming colors and numbers at nothing. My wife was worried. Home schooling was hard. The piano teacher bailed. The government wasn’t being clear about whether or not people could go to the park. Also, she thought maybe we were all going to die? She talked about escaping to the Tuscan hills, “Decameron” style, where her parents had a house, but decided to stay put, and responded with the fortitude of other Italians. She stayed home. She taught handwriting and multiplication tables. She stocked up. She drank a glass of wine with friends during a FaceTime aperitivo. I got updates about their life during our live-streamed dinners. I listened to cereal sliding out of the box, ceramic bowls clanking, the oven door closing. Elena practiced piano. I told her how good it was coming along. “Wait, where are you?” she said “I’m in my jail!” I said. “No, I mean where’s the phone,” she said. I had become a disembodied voice. Face-timed flesh. After midnight, when my stories were put to bed, I’d call back to my parents in New York. My father had a not-minor surgery planned this week and there was no way I could go back home now. They were precisely the age of people I had been quarantined to protect. Still, my mother was weighing whether or not to bring my father to see “Riverdance.” (“Riverdance!”) Small dry coughs caused me to freeze. I took my temperature a lot. Sometimes I wore my mask alone. As Italy tightened its lockdown, hardly anyone walked on my street and those who did wore masks. When I wasn’t on the phone, all I heard were birds, distant car door slams and conversations from open windows. When even those sounds faded, the city was as quiet as that Alpine mountainside. As I prepare to leave quarantine, everyone is taking precautions. Claudia and the kids have started wearing masks on the walk over to see me. My mother gave up “Riverdance"" and could not visit my father in the recovery room. People all over the world are staying inside. “I am a prisoner at home,” former Prime Minister Romano Prodi wrote me chirpily as we corresponded for a story. Neither of our circumstances seemed so special anymore. Updated March 24, 2020",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/world/europe/italy-coronavirus-frontlines-quarantine.html,world,The New York Times
100,2018-03-28 13:19:31,2018,3.0,28,"Michael S. Schmidt, Jo Becker, Mark Mazzetti, Maggie Haberman, Adam Goldman",Trump’s Lawyer Raised Prospect of Pardons for Flynn and Manafort,"WASHINGTON — A lawyer for President Trump broached the idea of Mr. Trump’s pardoning two of his former top advisers, Michael T. Flynn and Paul Manafort, with their lawyers last year, according to three people with knowledge of the discussions. The discussions came as the special counsel was building cases against both men, and they raise questions about whether the lawyer, John Dowd, who resigned last week, was offering pardons to influence their decisions about whether to plead guilty and cooperate in the investigation. The talks suggest that Mr. Trump’s lawyers were concerned about what Mr. Flynn and Mr. Manafort might reveal were they to cut a deal with the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, in exchange for leniency. Mr. Mueller’s team could investigate the prospect that Mr. Dowd made pardon offers to thwart the inquiry, although legal experts are divided about whether such offers might constitute obstruction of justice. Mr. Dowd’s conversation with Mr. Flynn’s lawyer, Robert K. Kelner, occurred sometime after Mr. Dowd took over last summer as the president’s personal lawyer, at a time when a grand jury was hearing evidence against Mr. Flynn on a range of potential crimes. Mr. Flynn, who served as Mr. Trump’s first national security adviser, agreed in late November to cooperate with the special counsel’s investigation. He pleaded guilty in December to lying to the F.B.I. about his conversations with the Russian ambassador and received favorable sentencing terms. Mr. Dowd has said privately that he did not know why Mr. Flynn had accepted a plea, according to one of the people. He said he had told Mr. Kelner that the president had long believed that the case against Mr. Flynn was flimsy and was prepared to pardon him, the person said. The pardon discussion with Mr. Manafort’s attorney, Reginald J. Brown, came before his client was indicted in October on charges of money laundering and other financial crimes. Mr. Manafort, the former chairman of Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign, has pleaded not guilty and has told others he is not interested in a pardon because he believes he has done nothing wrong and the government overstepped its authority. Mr. Brown is no longer his lawyer. It is unclear whether Mr. Dowd discussed the pardons with Mr. Trump before bringing them up with the other lawyers. Mr. Dowd, who was hired last year to defend the president during the Mueller inquiry, took the lead in dealing directly with Mr. Flynn’s and Mr. Manafort’s lawyers, according to two people familiar with how the legal team operated. He denied on Wednesday that he discussed pardons with lawyers for the president’s former advisers. “There were no discussions. Period,” Mr. Dowd said. “As far as I know, no discussions.” Contacted repeatedly over several weeks, the president’s lawyers representing him in the special counsel’s investigation maintained that they knew of no discussions of possible pardons. “Never during the course of my representation of the president have I had any discussions of pardons of any individual involved in this inquiry,” Jay Sekulow, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, said on Wednesday. Ty Cobb, the White House lawyer dealing with the investigation, added, “I have only been asked about pardons by the press and have routinely responded on the record that no pardons are under discussion or under consideration at the White House.” Mr. Kelner and Mr. Brown declined to comment. During interviews with Mr. Mueller’s investigators in recent months, current and former administration officials have recounted conversations they had with the president about potential pardons for former aides under investigation by the special counsel, according to two people briefed on the interviews. In one meeting with lawyers from the White House Counsel’s Office last year, Mr. Trump asked about the extent of his pardon power, according to a person briefed on the conversation. The lawyers explained that the president’s powers were broad, the person said. And in other meetings with senior advisers, the president raised the prospect of pardoning Mr. Flynn, according to two people present. Legal experts are divided about whether a pardon offer, even if given in exchange for continued loyalty, can be considered obstruction of justice. Presidents have constitutional authority to pardon people who face or were convicted of federal charges. But even if a pardon were ultimately aimed at hindering an investigation, it might still pass legal muster, said Jack Goldsmith, a former assistant attorney general in the George W. Bush administration and a professor at Harvard Law School. “There are few powers in the Constitution as absolute as the pardon power — it is exclusively the president’s and cannot be burdened by the courts or the legislature,” he said. “It would be very difficult to look at the president’s motives in issuing a pardon to make an obstruction case.” The remedy for such interference would more likely be found in elections or impeachment than in prosecuting the president, Mr. Goldsmith added. But pardon power is not unlimited, said Samuel W. Buell, a professor of law at Duke University. “The framers did not create the power to pardon as a way for the president to protect himself and his associates” from being prosecuted for their own criminal behavior, he said. Under Mr. Buell’s interpretation, Mr. Dowd’s efforts could be used against the president in an obstruction case if prosecutors want to demonstrate that it was part of larger conspiracy to impede the special counsel investigation. Mr. Dowd is said to believe that the president has nearly unlimited pardon authority, but he and others have repeatedly insisted that no pardon offers have been made. In July, amid reports that Mr. Trump was considering granting pardons to his associates under investigation, Mr. Dowd told BuzzFeed that “there is nothing going on on pardons, research — nothing.” And about two weeks after Mr. Flynn’s guilty plea, Mr. Trump said that such talk was premature. “I don’t want to talk about pardons for Michael Flynn yet,” Mr. Trump told reporters on Dec. 15 on the South Lawn of the White House. “We’ll see what happens. Let’s see. I can say this: When you look at what’s gone on with the F.B.I. and with the Justice Department, people are very, very angry.” Mr. Trump has been preoccupied with the investigation into Mr. Flynn since at least early last year. In February 2017, alone in the Oval Office with the F.B.I. director at the time, James B. Comey, the president asked him to end the investigation, Mr. Comey told lawmakers. After that episode became public, Mr. Mueller was appointed by the Justice Department to be the special counsel. On the day after Mr. Flynn pleaded guilty, the president wrote in a Twitter post said to be composed by Mr. Dowd that he fired Mr. Flynn for, among other things, lying to the F.B.I. But Mr. Trump continued to publicly defend his former national security adviser, saying two days later that he felt “very badly” for Mr. Flynn and that the F.B.I. had “destroyed his life.” It is not clear what Mr. Flynn has told the special counsel as part of his cooperation agreement. During interviews with other witnesses, Mr. Mueller’s investigators have focused on what Mr. Flynn told the president about his calls during the transition with the Russian ambassador to the United States at the time, Sergey I. Kislyak. The calls came soon after the Obama administration announced new sanctions on Russia for its role in disrupting the 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Manafort, who ran Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign for several months, has been indicted on dozens of counts of money laundering and other financial crimes connected to his work as a lobbyist and former consultant for Viktor F. Yanukovych, who at the time was president of Ukraine. The charges are not connected to any work that Mr. Manafort did for Mr. Trump. Rick Gates, who was Mr. Manafort’s business partner for years and also served as deputy chairman of the Trump presidential campaign, pleaded guilty last month as part of a cooperation agreement with Mr. Mueller’s team. On the day the plea agreement was announced, Mr. Manafort vowed to continue to fight the charges against him. In total, 19 people have been charged with crimes by Mr. Mueller. Five of them, including Mr. Flynn and two other Trump associates, have pleaded guilty and have agreed to cooperate. In August, Mr. Trump pardoned Joe Arpaio, the former sheriff from Arizona who had been found guilty of federal criminal contempt for refusing to stop targeting Latinos in traffic stops and other law enforcement efforts. The pardon prompted an outcry because Mr. Arpaio, whose crackdown on illegal immigration made him a national symbol for both conservatives and liberals, had supported Mr. Trump’s run for president. Mr. Trump’s only other pardon came this month, for a sailor who had pleaded guilty to unlawfully retaining national defense information and obstruction of justice after he took cellphone photos on a nuclear submarine and then destroyed the photos when he learned he was under investigation. When announcing the pardon, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said that Mr. Trump appreciated the sailor’s “service to the country.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/28/us/politics/trump-pardon-michael-flynn-paul-manafort-john-dowd.html,us,The New York Times
101,2019-08-28 10:00:06,2019,8.0,28,Noel Murray,When John Grisham Movies Were King,"Bill Clinton was president, the New South was ascendant and legal thrillers were topping the box office. In the opening minutes of the 1993 movie “The Firm,” an in-demand Harvard Law School graduate named Mitch McDeere takes meetings with one legal firm after another, each offering him a different vision for his future. Does he want to be a judge someday? Would he like to have a lighter workload so he can start a family? Does the California lifestyle sound appealing? How about Wall Street? Mitch (played with no small amount of “Top Gun” swagger by Tom Cruise) ends up choosing the under-the-radar firm Bendini, Lambert & Locke, in Memphis. He’s impressed by its down-home charm and likes that it is off the beaten path. New York? D.C.? That’s been done. Time to give Tennessee a try. In a way, Mitch was a lot like America as a whole, circa 1993, when the “New South” was on the rise. I was living in my hometown, Nashville, Tenn., at the time, and I had just graduated from the University of Georgia. I was tracking all the little victories for my region — just as I was counting all the division titles for my beloved Atlanta Braves. In 1993, the country had just put the former Arkansas governor Bill Clinton in the White House, with the former Tennessee senator Al Gore as his vice president. The Atlanta hip-hop acts TLC, Kriss Kross and Arrested Development were all over the Billboard charts. The sitcom “Designing Women,” set in Georgia, was a staple in the Nielsen Top 10. And masses of readers were buying the legal thrillers written by the Mississippi lawyer John Grisham. The summer of 1993 was a particularly good time for Grisham. His fourth book, “The Client,” was still sitting high on the New York Times best-seller list, three months after reaching No. 1. And on the Wednesday before the Fourth of July, the movie adaptation of Grisham’s “The Firm” opened in multiplexes across the country, on its way to becoming the summer’s third biggest domestic box-office earner, right behind “Jurassic Park” and “The Fugitive.” These days, it’s hard to imagine that a legal thriller — even one led by a reliable draw like Cruise — could become a summer blockbuster. “The Firm” wasn’t a surprise hit, either. Paramount expected it to be a smash; that’s why it had the coveted holiday weekend release. That’s what a phenomenon Grisham was at the time. “The Firm” wasn’t Grisham’s first novel. But it was the first to break big, and the film remains the best cinematic adaptation of a Grisham novel. Four other adaptations also hit the big screen during Clinton’s first term: “The Pelican Brief,” also released in 1993; “The Client,” from 1994; and “A Time to Kill” and “The Chamber,” both from 1996. Three of those — “The Firm,” “The Pelican Brief” and “A Time to Kill” — opened in the top spot at the domestic box office. Set mostly in Tennessee, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi, all five examine to some degree what had and hadn’t changed in the south since the Jim Crow days. The movie versions of Grisham’s stories take their lead from the author’s obvious outrage at the South’s persistent racial and class divisions. His heroes tend to be young men who grew up poor and had to work multiple jobs to put themselves through law school. Their sympathies lie with the underdogs — most famously in “A Time to Kill,” in which a struggling lawyer defends a black man for killing the racists who raped and beat his 10-year-old daughter. The political and judicial systems depicted in Grisham novels and films were biased against people of color and anyone who struggled to pay the bills. Judging by his books (and their movie adaptations), Grisham — like Clinton and Gore — seemed to believe in a newer, more middle-of-the-road kind of Southern leadership, which balanced progressive attitudes about social justice with more regressive ideas about reducing crime and maintaining order. The most telling moment in any Grisham movie comes in “A Time to Kill,” when a scrappy attorney played by Matthew McConaughey sits in a soul food restaurant and explains to a crusading liberal played by Sandra Bullock that while he leans left, he’s “not a card-carrying A.C.L.U. radical.” Among other things, he believes homicide can be justified. I’ve lived my whole life in the South: born in Atlanta, raised in Nashville, moved to Central Arkansas in 1999. I’ve seen common character in southern politicians and social activists. They’re a lot like SEC football coaches: stubbornly self-assured, charmingly folksy and beholden to the demands of their wealthy boosters. The good ol’ boy network connects to powerful people on both the left and the right; and sometimes the obligations to donors supersedes ideals. Grisham himself served in the Mississippi House of Representatives — as a Democrat — from 1984 to 1990. He gave up politics shortly before “The Firm” was published in 1991, and the law not long after. Grisham’s disillusionment with those professions suffuses both his books and their movie adaptations. It is evident in “The Pelican Brief,” in which a presidential administration is complicit in a scheme to stack the Supreme Court with justices who will let a well-heeled donor drill for oil in protected Louisiana marshlands. It’s obvious, too, in “The Client,” in which the F.B.I. and an ambitious United States attorney callously try to destroy the life of the preteen witness of a capital crime. “The Firm” is about the temptations of power and the appeal of southern living. Mitch is seduced by the sense of old-fashioned brotherhood he finds at Bendini, Lambert & Locke. His new employers pay him more money than anyone else is offering — in a city with a relatively low cost of living. He is drawn to a place where folks serve barbecued ribs at formal meetings, and where he gets to show off what a down-to-earth, soulful dude he is by doing back flips down Beale Street alongside a young black street performer. So, sure … it takes Mitch a while to realize that he is actually working for crooks who launder money for the mob and have whistle-blowers killed. As a group, the films form an enlightening snapshot of Clinton-era America, documenting what ordinary citizens were worried about at the time — including the corporate pillaging of the environment (“The Pelican Brief”) and the threat of insurgent armed militias (“A Time to Kill”) — while also asking whether dedicated young professionals from below the Mason-Dixon line could save the day. “The Firm” is more about the finer points of tax law and the perniciousness of organized crime than it is about the particular ways the wealthy exploited political divisions and stymied the working class in the early 1990s. But “The Firm” does represent the purest expression of the common Grisham character arc, wherein well-meaning men or women with troubled pasts turn to the law for redemption. Invariably, they are disappointed to find they have to rely on truth bending and dirty tricks to make the system work the way it should. Intentionally or not, “The Firm” today doesn’t look only like the story of a frustrated idealist. It’s more a cautionary tale, aimed at anyone who strides optimistically into a new era — with new leaders — expecting big changes. All too often, the same old favor-trading and compromises prevail.” That’s why “The Firm” still resonates: In addition to recalling a bygone era, when a mature mid-budget mystery movie could anchor a Hollywood studio’s summer schedule, it remains astute about the way it feels when hope gives way to exhaustion. The movie begins with exuberant back flips down Beale Street. But in the end, the hero can only pore over paperwork, looking desperately for loopholes. An earlier version of this article described incorrectly some events in the film ""A Time to Kill."" The 10-year-old girl in the story was raped and beaten, but she was not murdered.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/28/movies/john-grisham-movies-the-firm.html,movies,The New York Times
102,2019-01-23 16:45:44,2019,1.0,23,"Selam Gebrekidan, Norimitsu Onishi","South Africa Leader, Wooing Investors, Pledges End to Corruption","LONDON — South Africa’s president said Wednesday that his corruption-ridden party, the African National Congress, had lost its founding values and now faced a “Damascus moment” in trying to regain the people’s confidence and support. “We have said to ourselves: ‘We cannot carry on like this. We have deviated from the values and the principles that have always defined the A.N.C.,’” President Cyril Ramaphosa said in an interview with The New York Times in Davos, Switzerland, where he was attending the World Economic Forum. “People have lost confidence in us,” said Mr. Ramaphosa, who will lead his party in national elections that will most likely be held in May. Repeating the message he was pushing at the forum, Mr. Ramaphosa said efforts to clean up the African National Congress were already underway. And he pledged to return the party of Nelson Mandela to its past glory. Revelations from a continuing high-level inquiry into corruption during the tenure of Mr. Ramaphosa’s predecessor, the scandal-tainted Jacob Zuma, have led his country to a “cathartic moment,” the South African leader said. “That sort of moment — Damascus moment for us — has actually enabled us to get to grip with what needs to be done,” he said. He added, “We will be able to turn a new chapter on the life of our country, rid of corruption.” Seeking investments to give a jolt to South Africa’s sluggish economy, Mr. Ramaphosa attempted to repair the reputation of his party at the gathering of world leaders and investors in Davos. Since becoming president last February, Mr. Ramaphosa has been unable to fulfill his promises to deliver growth and more jobs, with his country’s economy hobbled by endemic corruption in the government and state-owned enterprises. In Davos on Wednesday, Mr. Ramaphosa repeated some of the same messages he has been delivering at home in the past year. But the issue is still whether he can deliver on his promises. Mr. Ramaphosa has started to clean out certain ministries, agencies and state enterprises, removing key allies of Mr. Zuma under whom corruption flourished. But Mr. Ramaphosa’s support inside the A.N.C. remains uncertain, and with just months left before the elections, he has struggled to unite the party behind him. Though the A.N.C. is expected to win the most votes, it is far from clear whether Mr. Ramaphosa will get a big enough victory to claim a mandate and aggressively root out corruption, as his allies say he wants to do. For now, several political allies of Mr. Zuma who have long been accused of corruption serve in his cabinet or at the highest levels of the party. And Mr. Ramaphosa’s own government has been tainted by allegations of the same sort of self-dealing that led to the ouster of Mr. Zuma. Most prominently, his deputy, David Mabuza, was a longtime leader of a small province where corruption was endemic. Mr. Mabuza has been accused of siphoning money meant for education and other services to finance his meteoric rise in national politics — and deliver the votes that gave Mr. Ramaphosa a slim victory in party elections in December 2017. When an article detailing Mr. Mabuza’s rise was published in The Times last August, the deputy president was questioned in Parliament by opposition lawmakers and even criticized by members of his own party in the news media. Mr. Ramaphosa did not comment on Mr. Mabuza then. Asked about his deputy in the interview Wednesday, Mr. Ramaphosa defended him, though not forcefully. “None of the issues that have been alleged against him has, as far as I know, been brought to either the police or the criminal justice system,” Mr. Ramaphosa said. The country’s prosecutors, he said, would act “without fear, prejudice or favor” should such evidence emerge. “As a leader, if allegations like that are made against you, you want them to be proven,” Mr. Ramaphosa said. But the national prosecuting authority is one of the government institutions that were weakened during Mr. Zuma’s presidency. Despite a series of scandals that have rocked the country, few have been held to account for large-scale corruption that has put South Africa’s future in question. At a news conference in Davos, Mr. Ramaphosa said he had “taken steps to strengthen the prosecuting authority.” In recent years, the A.N.C., which once inspired people across Africa and the world, has come to symbolize deep-rooted corruption. Party leaders have stolen tens of billions of dollars meant to lift up poor black South Africans. They have gutted key government institutions like the tax agency, to gain better access to government accounts. They have even taken to eliminating rivals, in Mafia-like assassinations. Mr. Ramaphosa acknowledged the slow pace of progress, saying that “things like corruption become a way of life.” But he underlined his commitment to deal with the issue ahead of the elections. “This time we’re not just saying it, we’re living it,” he said, adding, “because if we don’t do so, we’re going to be punished at the polls.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/23/world/africa/south-africa-corruption.html,world,The New York Times
103,2019-04-03 16:14:57,2019,4.0,3,"Helene Cooper, Julian E. Barnes","In Rare Speech to Congress, NATO Leader Says Allies Must Deter Moscow","WASHINGTON — The NATO secretary general gave a strong defense of the 70-year-old military alliance between Europe and the United States, using a high-profile appearance before a joint session of Congress on Wednesday to urge allies to stand up to a more assertive Russia. While the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is not looking for a new Cold War with Moscow, the alliance’s leader, Jens Stoltenberg, said it was important to not be “naïve” about the Kremlin’s intentions. Proffering a long list of Russian actions that threaten NATO allies, including the annexation of Crimea, the use of a nerve agent in Britain and Moscow’s interference in democratic elections, Mr. Stoltenberg cited “a pattern of Russian behavior” that calls for the alliance to be more united than ever in its response. “NATO will always take the necessary steps to provide credible and effective deterrence,” Mr. Stoltenberg said at the Capitol. He was in Washington for a meeting of foreign ministers from NATO member states. But his remarks came in the middle of a poorly timed squabble between two of the alliance’s fractious members — the United States and Turkey — with Russia as the potential beneficiary. Earlier this week, the Pentagon announced that it was halting the delivery of parts for F-35 fighter jets to Turkey because Ankara is pursuing plans to buy S-400 missile defense systems from Russia. American officials do not want Turkey to purchase the Russian system and have warned that it could collect information on United States stealth fighter jets. The Turkish foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, was adamant in a separate alliance event in Washington on Wednesday that Ankara will not budge. “It’s a done deal,” he said. “Turkey doesn’t have to choose between Russia and any others, and we don’t see our relationship with Russia as an alternative to others.” But the Trump administration, so far, is being equally adamant. “Turkey must choose,” Vice President Mike Pence said at a NATO anniversary event. “Does it want to remain a critical partner in the most successful military alliance in history, or does it want to risk the security of that partnership by making such reckless decisions that undermine our alliance?” Mr. Stoltenberg, in his speech before Congress, did not directly reference the F-35 squabble. But he characterized fights among alliance partners as “democracy.” “Open discussions and different views is not a sign of weakness,” Mr. Stoltenberg said. “It is a sign of strength.” He also reaffirmed NATO’s core mandate of collective defense — that an attack on one member state is viewed as an attack on all 29. But in doing so, Mr. Stoltenberg aired a principle that President Trump has questioned, exposing the new rift that has developed between his administration and the United States’ most important allies. Wednesday’s speech was the first time that a secretary general of the alliance has been invited to speak on Congress’s most high-profile stage, and the platform afforded to Mr. Stoltenberg was in many ways a sign of lawmakers’ concerns over Mr. Trump’s commitment to NATO. Mr. Stoltenberg, a careful diplomat, made no criticism of Mr. Trump, and instead credited the president with prodding the alliance to spend more on defense. Still, the overall theme of Mr. Stoltenberg’s speech was to make the case for NATO, the value of which Mr. Trump has often questioned. Lawmakers gave Mr. Stoltenberg a series of standing ovations. Legislation that has bipartisan support is making its way through Congress, and would explicitly prohibit any president from withdrawing the United States from the alliance without Senate approval. In his speech, which was peppered with political and personal details, Mr. Stoltenberg said the military alliance has been good not just for Europe, but for the United States as well. He reminded lawmakers that the only time NATO has invoked Article 5 — the pact of collective defense following attacks — was after the terrorist strikes against the United States on Sept. 11, 2001. “The strength of a nation,” Mr. Stoltenberg said, “is not only measured by the size of its economy or the number of its soldiers, but also by the number of its friends.” “And through NATO, the United States has more friends and allies than any other power,” he said. “This has made the United States stronger, safer and more secure.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/03/us/politics/nato-congress-russia-.html,us,The New York Times
104,2020-02-21 09:00:07,2020,2.0,21,Nellie Bowles,The Week in Tech: Coronavirus Hits Apple’s Financial Forecast,"The iPhone maker, which depends on both factories and consumers in China, could be a bellwether for other big tech companies. Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily Coronavirus
 newsletter.
 Hello, New York Times tech readers. I’m Nellie Bowles, the tech and culture reporter, here now with the roundup of the news. It was a week that captured the central issues of tech in 2020: privacy versus the convenience of smart home devices, dependence on the smooth running of China’s manufacturing industry, battles over regulation in Europe and the lockdown on internal dissent at Silicon Valley companies. So to those wanting to take a break from the endless Democratic primary jockeying, settle into a good chair, because what the week brought you is a basket of beautiful tech features. We begin: Coronavirus is starting to affect tech production lines and demand for products. Apple cut its sales expectations for the quarter, citing the virus’s impact on factories and stores. The warning was a clear indication of how big the company has bet on China and how the impact of the outbreak might ripple out into the global economy, explored in an article by Daisuke Wakabayashi. Amazon executives are also preparing for coronavirus disruptions. An article by Karen Weise and Michael Corkery outlined the measures the company is taking to hedge against the potential that the impact of the virus gets worse. The Everything Store is “making larger and more frequent orders of Chinese-made products that had already been shipped to the United States,” they wrote. Updated Feb. 26, 2020 But at the same time, some suppliers are trying to lower demand, cutting back on advertising and promotions so they don’t run out of stuff. Speaking of Amazon: Not everyone agrees on where to draw the line between privacy and convenience, sometimes not even everyone in the same house. One couple fighting over whether to keep an Alexa-enabled Echo speaker in the home invented their own solution: a bracelet of silence that jams microphones. Wear it and it’s like smart-home armor. The tale of the couple, two computer science professors, was brought to us by Kashmir Hill. But if you do agree on getting something that records video and listens — especially a Ring doorbell — there are some privacy best practices, which Brian X. Chen outlined in his latest Tech Fix column. There are many, many steps required, including getting a burner phone number. And his conclusion: “If that all sounds like a lot of effort just to use a security camera, that’s because the security concerns make Ring products impractical to own.” In Europe, leaders are very good at regulating technology, pioneering responses to issues of privacy and antitrust, but can it build tech giants of its own? My colleagues Adam Satariano and Monika Pronczuk wrote: “As Europe has created a reputation as the world’s most aggressive watchdog of Silicon Valley, it has failed to nurture its own tech ecosystem. That has left countries in the region increasingly dependent on companies that many leaders distrust.” Now it is trying to change that and reclaim “technological sovereignty.” Not surprisingly, Silicon Valley companies have been making more trips to Brussels recently to lobby against some of that regulation: a new digital policy, including first-of-its-kind rules on the ways that artificial intelligence can be used by companies, Adam wrote. Noam Scheiber and Kate Conger had a big story in the The New York Times Magazine on the Great Google Revolt: what happened when a group of employees tried to make the company stop doing work they saw as unethical. Mostly, they were fired. Dive into the article to understand how Google went from an ultra-transparent company that encouraged employee dissent to, well, not. The Style section’s Penelope Green took us to deathbeds. As more people choose to die at home and more families have smartphones, deathbed photos are returning. “What’s happening now is that people are taking back that process,” said Stanley B. Burns, 81, an ophthalmologist who runs the Burns Archive, a collection of post-mortem and medical photos. “But the impulse to photograph is the same as it was for the Victorians.” Our colleague in Opinion, Susan Fowler, shook the tech world in 2017 when she wrote a first-person account of working at Uber and suffering the indignities and discrimination of a sexist, start-up workplace. Her memoir, “Whistleblower: My Journey to Silicon Valley and Fight for Justice at Uber,” is out now, and the Book Review called it “a powerful illustration of the obstacles our society continues to throw up in the paths of ambitious young women.” Marker, a new business site by Medium, is rolling out some great stories this week including a series on “The New Rules of the I.P.O.” Kickstarter officially voted to unionize. There have been large efforts to organize tech labor, but many have faltered. San Diego is likely to recognize Instacart workers as employees rather than independent contractors, according to a story in Bloomberg Law. A general reminder from The New York Times Magazine’s Future of Work issue: Professional video game players are in high demand as the industry competes for talent, and now they make even more money. According to Newzoo, a games-and-e-sports analytics company, competitive e-sports revenue last year was about $1.1 billion, an almost 27 percent increase from 2018, Robert Capps wrote.

105,2018-10-19 06:23:42,2018,10.0,19,,DealBook Briefing: It May Be Business (Almost) as Usual With Saudi Arabia,"Good Friday. Want this by email? Sign up here. More prominent figures dropped out of the Future Investment Initiative conference yesterday, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. But don’t expect huge changes in the world’s relationship with the Saudis in the wake of the disappearance and suspected killing of a prominent Saudi journalist. President Trump appears to be taking a tougher stance on reports that Saudi officials authorized the alleged assassination of the journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, and has come close to acknowledging Saudi royals’ role in the matter. Goldman Sachs, which also dropped out of the conference yesterday, took a particularly strong line: “This incident is unacceptable and clearly they have to answer questions,” David Solomon, the bank’s C.E.O., told CNBC. But many others are trying to find ways to preserve ties with the Saudis and their wealth. Some Republicans allied with Mr. Trump have begun disparaging Mr. Khashoggi to support the president’s reluctance to take a hard line, according to the WaPo: In recent days, a cadre of conservative House Republicans allied with Trump has been privately exchanging articles from right-wing outlets that fuel suspicion of Khashoggi, highlighting his association with the Muslim Brotherhood in his youth and raising conspiratorial questions about his work decades ago as an embedded reporter covering Osama bin Laden, according to four G.O.P. officials involved in the discussions who were not authorized to speak publicly. Meanwhile, Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, urged the president to stand by the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, arguing that the outrage would fade. Defense contractors like Boeing and Lockheed Martin are also expected to keep close ties to Saudi Arabia, one of their biggest customers. So expect much existing business with the Saudis to continue — albeit more quietly. More Saudi news: Twitter suspended a network of bots that was pushing pro-Saudi messages. The Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Brooklyn Museum won’t use Saudi money for planned exhibitions on the Middle East. Before he bought Sears in 2005, Eddie Lampert was considered an investing wunderkind. But now that the retailer has filed for bankruptcy protection, the financier is reckoning with his legacy — and tells the NYT that he, too, has suffered. More from Jim Stewart’s interview with Mr. Lampert: “I’ve taken a huge personal hit,” Mr. Lampert told me this week in a wide-ranging interview, his first since the bankruptcy filing. “Not just in money, but time. There’s been an enormous opportunity cost.” Mr. Lampert said that he had seen an opportunity to reinvent Sears, but had underestimated how tough it would be. For instance, a plan to convert parts of Sears stores into internet cafes failed in part because he didn’t have the right store leaders or C.E.O. (It’s worth noting that Mr. Lampert has been criticized for neglecting Sears stores, which gained a reputation for looking shabby.) Ultimately, Mr. Lampert absolved himself, telling Mr. Stewart: “I’ve never worked harder or stretched further beyond my limits.” But as Julie Creswell and Michael Corkery of the NYT note, Mr. Lampert has profited from the retailer despite its plummeting stock. He owns big stakes in Lands’ End, which was spun off from the company, and in Sears’s real estate — both of which are successful, and neither of which can be touched by the bankruptcy proceedings. The Chinese economy grew 6.5 percent in the three months that ended in September, compared with a year earlier. That may sound healthy, but it’s the slowest growth China has experienced since 2009. Alexandra Stevenson of the NYT describes the scene on the ground: Wages are stagnant. Investment in splashy infrastructure projects has dropped sharply. China’s stock market is firmly in the red — it has fallen by 30 percent since a peak in January — making it one of the world’s worst performing. The currency has weakened and is hovering near a 10-year low against the American dollar. Companies are complaining that they cannot get money from lenders, and a handful are defaulting on their loans. Beijing officials blamed “an extremely complicated and severe international situation.” This is the first growth report since the country’s trade war with the U.S. began to escalate in July. A round of tariffs introduced by the Trump administration in late September could make the next report even worse. Returning to higher growth won’t be straightforward. China is trying to balance investment and debt to keep its economy ticking, and officials have been forced to shore up confidence among investors to help ensure markets don’t continue to fall. The bigger picture: How geopolitical tensions could slow growth around the globe. Europe and Asia may move forward on trade. The E.U. is expected to sign a bilateral trade pact with Singapore and to continue negotiating one with Japan during meetings in Brussels. A snapshot of the U.S. housing market’s health. The National Association of Realtors will publish data on existing home sales, which will show whether high prices are tempting owners to put their homes on the market. Economists expect continued slowness. Another days of earnings reports. Honeywell International is expected to post strong results as commercial jet orders boom. Procter & Gamble may disclose weak demand for some of its product lines. Just when things were looking up, stocks slid again yesterday. The S.&P. 500 fell 1.4 percent, leaving the index down nearly 5 percent so far this month. Tech firms led the drop: The Nasdaq fell more than 2 percent. Matt Phillips of the NYT explains that China is proving to be a drag: Growing concerns about the health of its economy, along with rising interest rates that could slow the American economy, have made investors jumpy and worried that a near-perfect investing environment — low inflation, strong growth and relatively low interest rates — is becoming tougher to navigate. What’s next is unclear. We are in the middle of earnings season, and a spate of positive results could invigorate the markets: Mr. Phillips notes that Apple’s quarterly report could be particularly important, given its manufacturing and sales presence in China. This year’s midterms have seen a huge increase in small donations, particularly to Democrats. But America’s chief executives still give almost three times as much to Republicans as to Democrats. MarketWatch compiled graphics on how business leaders are donating their personal money. Some of the results: • C.E.O.s who clashed with the Trump administration, including Hock Tan of Broadcom and Randall Stephenson of AT&T, still donated entirely to Republican causes. • Top Silicon Valley executives, like Marc Benioff of Salesforce and Reed Hastings of Netflix, tended to give to Democrats. • The most generous C.E.O. donor was Jeff Bezos of Amazon, who donated equally to Democrats and Republicans. Artificial intelligence is lauded as a technology that will transform almost every aspect of our lives in the coming years. But it can be hard to see past the breathless enthusiasm to understand how it works and what its true impact will be.

106,2019-03-04 14:17:11,2019,3.0,4,"Alisha Haridasani Gupta, Melina Delkic","China, Huawei, Michael Jackson: Your Tuesday Briefing","Let us help you start your day. (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Chinese officials gather for an annual policy session, Huawei prepares to challenge the U.S. in court and Michael Jackson fans jump to his defense. Here’s the latest: The annual session of the National People’s Congress begins today and trade, particularly with the U.S., is expected to dominate much of the agenda. The Trump administration is close to signing a trade deal with China, according to people with knowledge of the talks, that would roll back tariffs on both sides of the Pacific in exchange for changes to some of China’s economic policies that prevent American companies from operating there. Case in point: The National People’s Congress will likely approve a string of sweeping new foreign investment rules aimed at addressing the issues that the U.S. and other Western countries have repeatedly raised with Beijing, including easing the transfer of technology to Chinese companies. Criticism: The new law lacks any details on enforcement and some experts suggest it doesn’t go far enough. Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s chief financial officer and the daughter of the company’s founder, has been staying at her luxurious six-bedroom house in Vancouver since she was granted bail in December. And she has been allowed to go shopping or even travel to nearby Richmond, albeit while under surveillance. Her conditions contrast sharply with those of two Canadian men who were detained in China in apparent retaliation for Ms. Meng’s arrest and have been held in secret locations for months, a fact that has touched on a nerve among locals. The Chinese authorities on Monday accused both men of espionage, ratcheting up tensions between the two countries, just days before a Canadian court is set to begin hearing whether Ms. Meng should be extradited to the U.S., where she is wanted on fraud charges. In other Huawei news: The company is set to file a lawsuit against the American government for banning its federal agencies from using its products, according to two people familiar with the matter. The case could undermine the Trump administration’s campaign to shut out Huawei from the global market. Jerrold Nadler, a powerful lawmaker in the House of Representatives, issued scores of demands for documents from President Trump’s cabinet, aides, businesses and associates. The letters reveal a broad Democratic investigation into possible obstruction of justice, corruption and abuse of power by Mr. Trump and his administration. Mr. Nadler did not mention the word impeachment, but twice in the last 50 years, the committee he serves on has drawn up impeachment articles based on such themes. Other congressional committees are looking into Russian influence on the 2016 elections. Scope: The demands went to 81 agencies, individuals and other entities, including the Trump Organization, the Trump campaign, the Trump Foundation, the presidential inaugural committee, the White House, the Justice Department, the F.B.I. and dozens of the president’s closest aides. The topics covered include the firing of James Comey as F.B.I. director; attempts to remove the special counsel, Robert Mueller; and Mr. Trump’s apparent dangling of pardons and threatening of witnesses. What’s next: Mr. Nadler could follow up with subpoenas to compel testimony, but those could be challenged in court — meaning potentially long delays. Juan Guaidó, the opposition leader, returned to the country this week after defying a travel ban, possibly setting up a showdown with President Nicolás Maduro. “We just got through passport control and will head where our people are!” he posted on Twitter from an airport near Caracas. It was not immediately clear whether he would be detained by government security forces. But Mr. Maduro’s government has said Mr. Guaidó violated restrictions on his travel and could face arrest. Response: As Mr. Guaidó flew into the country, large military contingents surrounded the Simón Bolívar Airport. A number of European diplomats had come to the airport to offer their support. And on Twitter, John Bolton, President Trump’s national security adviser, warned: “Any threats or acts against his safe return will be met with a strong and significant response from the United States and the international community.” Context: When Mr. Guaidó left Venezuela on Feb. 23 to help bring much-needed aid into the country, it wasn’t clear whether he would be allowed to return. He has become a growing challenge to the Maduro government since he declared himself interim president in January. New Zealand: Mark Taylor, who joined the Islamic State in 2014 before deciding to escape the terrorist organization in December, won’t lose his citizenship but will face charges if he returns home, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said, outlining a milder approach than the United States’ or Britain’s toward the group’s former fighters. Hong Kong: A native man who killed his girlfriend in Taiwan and returned home can’t be charged because Hong Kong doesn’t have an extradition agreement with Taiwan. The dilemma has prompted calls to re-examine the city’s legal cooperation with other jurisdictions, including mainland China, but critics worry that a change would enable Beijing to expand its control over the former British colony. Ted Baker: Ray Kelvin, the founder and chief executive of the British fashion chain, resigned after current and former employees accused him of inappropriate behavior, including trying to massage people in the office and asking employees for sex. North Korea: As President Trump met with Kim Jong-un in Vietnam, North Korean hackers continued attacking American and European businesses, including banks, utilities, and oil and gas companies, according to a report by the cybersecurity company McAfee. The finding further complicates the two nations’ denuclearization negotiations. Tornadoes: Rescue workers in the U.S. rushed to search for survivors after a cluster of storms ripped through the Southeast, from Alabama into Florida and Georgia, killing at least 23 people and leaving behind a trail of destruction. Egypt: The country freed a prominent photojournalist, Mahmoud Abou Zeid, who spent five and a half years in prison for taking pictures during 2013 protests in Cairo after the military’s takeover of the country. Mr. Abou Zeid vowed to continue his work despite a five-year probation during which he has to spend every night at the police station. Google: After conducting an internal wage equity study, the company found it was underpaying more men than women for similar work, a surprising conclusion that contrasted with the broader experience of women working in Silicon Valley. Napalm: Our tech columnist Kevin Roose weighs in on a fierce debate rippling through Silicon Valley over whether technology companies should work with the U.S. military, citing one of “the most notorious military contracts of the past century” — Dow Chemical’s decision to produce napalm during the Vietnam War. Michael Jackson: After the debut on Sunday of the first half of the HBO documentary “Leaving Neverland,” which includes allegations of sexual abuse against the pop star, Jackson’s fans came out in full force with what they viewed as evidence exonerating the singer. The director of the documentary called them “the Islamic State of fandom.” T. rex: The dinosaur has helped foster a surge in paleontology over the last 20 years, with rising numbers of researchers and new fossils, as well as increasing sophistication in techniques used to study finds. Among the discoveries around the predator potentate were its size range (early tyrannosaurs were as small as chickens) and its short life span. Tips for a more fulfilling life. Recipe of the day: Celebrate Mardi Gras with beignets and a muffuletta. Traveling can wreak havoc on your fitness, but our experts suggest six products to help you work out on the road. Your collectibles, from fine wines or shrunken heads, may be worth more than you think. Here are five ways to figure out the value of your assets. King cake is no ordinary cake. A Mardi Gras tradition, the circular pastry shines with stripes of sugared New Orleans Carnival colors: purple for justice, gold for power and green for faith. It’s stuffed with fruit and pecans — and a plastic baby that brings luck to the finder (along with the responsibility to provide the next year’s cake). The notion of embedding an object in cake dates at least to the Roman Empire. In the Saturnalia, a predecessor of Christmas, it was not a plastic baby but a fava bean. Whoever received the slice containing the bean ruled the day. But the Romans also associated fava beans with death. That might be because of a genetic disorder most common in the Mediterranean, which creates an often lethal bean allergy. So perhaps eating a cake with a fava bean was a morbid joke, a moment on the edge, or what could be thought of as letting the good times roll. James K. Williamson wrote today’s Back Story.

107,2020-03-28 08:02:10,2020,3.0,28,"Mujib Mashal, Najim Rahim",Taliban Attack Afghanistan Amid Growing Coronavirus Threat,"Insurgents launched major assaults as preparations continued for a prisoner exchange and as diplomats worked to revive the peace plan. KABUL, Afghanistan — The Taliban on Saturday attacked several provinces in northern Afghanistan, overrunning large parts of one district even as American diplomats expressed optimism that a peace process stalled over the release of prisoners was getting back on track. The insurgents launched major assaults in three northern province — in Kunduz, whose capital was overrun by the Taliban repeatedly in recent years, as well as in Faryab and Badakhshan. Some of the worst fighting occurred in Badakhshan Province, where the insurgents took control of much of the district of Yamgan and inflicted heavy casualties on Afghan forces in another district, Jurm. Amanullah Iman, who leads the executive branch of the Yamgan district office, said hundreds of Taliban fighters attacked soon after dawn and captured the district center after three hours of fighting. “There were five outposts in Yamgan district center, and the Taliban captured all of them,” Mr. Iman said. “The security forces escaped to a military base in another part of this district. The fighting rages despite an appeal for a cease-fire on humanitarian grounds to slow the spread of the coronavirus across the country. Though the Taliban say they have begun a public health campaign to combat the virus, they also have launched more than 300 attacks in the past week in the roughly dozen Afghan provinces that have reported positive cases. The capital, Kabul, as well as the western city of Herat, which has the largest number of cases as it shares a porous border with the badly hit Iran, have gone under partial lockdown. “During the day, we fight coronavirus. At night, our brothers, the Taliban. In the morning, we hold meetings on coronavirus. In the afternoon, on security,” said Naqibullah Faiq, who is a doctor and the governor of Faryab Province, where the Taliban have tried to overrun the Almar district in days of fighting. “This might be the dumbest war in the world’s history — that the world is going to quarantine, and we are busy fighting each other,” he said. In the Jurm district, officials initially feared that the Taliban had killed dozens of Afghan forces after the attacks left more than 30 soldiers unaccounted for. But around noon, 20 of the missing soldiers made their way to the district center, according to Abdullah Naji Nazari, a member of the provincial council in Badakhshan. “They told me that the Taliban killed 10 of the unaccounted soldiers, and three soldiers were taken prisoners,” Mr. Nazari said. In Kunduz Province, the Taliban launched attacks in the Ali Abad district, where two police officers were killed. For days now, intermittent fighting has also been reported on the outskirts of Kunduz City. The violence continues even as U.S. diplomats and Afghan officials reported progress on plans to release prisoners and on preparations for direct negotiations between the Taliban and the Afghan government. Both steps are laid out in a deal signed between the Taliban and the United States last month, but those steps were delayed by disagreements and complicated because of travel restrictions around the pandemic. And both appear to be bargained over down to the wire. As part of the deal, up to 5,000 Taliban prisoners must be freed in exchange for a thousand Afghan prisoners held by the insurgents. After the government of President Ashraf Ghani vehemently disagreed, details of a phased release have been ironed out with the Taliban in negotiations held over the past week via video conference. The prisoner release is expected to begin on March 31. Yet, a spokesman for Afghanistan’s national security council on Saturday said they believed the Taliban didn’t really have 1,000 Afghan prisoners in their control to fulfill the exchange. The Taliban, in return, claimed their prisoners at the Bagram prison, a former American detention facility transferred to the Afghan government, had all of a sudden started experiencing brutal treatment the kind “not seen in the past years.” The Afghan government also finally announced on Friday the team it has selected to represent the country in its negotiations with the Taliban: 16 men and five women led by the country’s former intelligence chief, Masoom Stanekzai. The agreement over a negotiating team took nearly a year of effort and consultations with different factions, and was hampered by an election crisis that has split the country’s government. Mr. Ghani was declared the winner, and his chief rival, Abdullah Abdullah, also swore himself in as president. The Taliban, in a statement, noted that the Afghan government’s negotiating team was not inclusive and had not been supported by many of the faction — a statement that appeared to drive a wedge and exploit the divisions. The United States cut $1 billion in aid to the government because the two men couldn't sort out their disagreements, which have threatened to derail the U.S. peace plan that offers an exit from the long war. On Friday, the chief American diplomat leading the peace efforts, Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad, welcomed the announcement of a negotiating team. “This consensus is a meaningful step that moves the parties significantly closer to intra-Afghan negotiations,” Mr. Khalilzad said.

108,2019-05-08 12:08:07,2019,5.0,8,Cecilia Kang,F.T.C. Commissioners Back Privacy Law to Regulate Tech Companies,"Members of the Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday renewed their calls for Congress to create a national privacy law that would regulate how big tech companies like Facebook and Google collect and handle user data. In testimony before the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on consumer protection, commissioners also asked Congress to strengthen the agency’s ability to police violations, and they sought more resources and greater authority to impose penalties. Lawmakers are considering a national privacy law to regulate the collection and handling of user data, the most valuable currency of the internet economy. The idea has won the support of some Silicon Valley executives, and drew Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, to meet with lawmakers this week. But progress has stalled over disagreements on the details of such a law, putting the United States far behind nations in Europe and beyond that have led a global charge to curb the growing power of big tech companies. “We urge Congress to enact privacy and data security legislation, enforceable by the F.T.C.,” Joseph Simons, the agency’s chairman, said at the hearing. The agency is nearing one of its most consequential decisions on privacy. The F.T.C. is in settlement talks with Facebook after a 13-month investigation into privacy violations, a decision that will set the bar for future enforcement of online privacy and provide a blueprint for regulation. The case is also a test for Mr. Simons, a Republican appointed by President Trump, who is leading the settlement talks with Facebook. The agency is expected to impose a $3 billion to $5 billion penalty on Facebook for violating a 2011 privacy settlement with the regulator, in what would be a record penalty against a tech company. The case was opened last year, after it was reported that a political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, had used a vast trove of Facebook data to compile voter profiles as part of its work on the 2016 presidential campaign. As part of a settlement over the Cambridge Analytica breach, Facebook is expected to create several positions dedicated to privacy compliance and oversight. The five F.T.C. commissioners, three Republicans and two Democrats, have been divided on how severe the punishment should be, according to three people familiar with internal discussions. At the hearing, Mr. Simons and other commissioners would not discuss the Facebook investigation, which is not completed. But comments from F.T.C. commissioners provided insight into their thinking on privacy cases. The two Democratic commissioners said a punishment should send a strong message that a tech company in violation of privacy rules must change behavior. And in some cases, the F.T.C. should name top executives as liable parties, they said. “For some firms fines are a parking ticket and the cost of doing business and cannot change behavior unless penalties are painful and finding out who at the top called the shots,” said Rohit Chopra, one of the Democratic commissioners. Mr. Chopra added that strong enforcement should include “looking at the role of individuals who made the decision that it was worth violating the law in order to profit.” The issue of executive responsibility has been a divisive topic during the F.T.C.’s settlement negotiations with Facebook, according to two people familiar with the decision. At one point, F.T.C. officials proposed naming Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, as a responsible party. That would subject him to financial and other penalties if Facebook ran afoul of privacy rules in the future. Mr. Zuckerberg is not expected to be made personally responsible in a final settlement. [Read more: Facebook faces a big penalty, but regulators are split over how big.] Republican members warned of going too far with a new privacy law. Christine Wilson, one of the three Republican commissioners, said there could be “unintended consequences,” and added that some privacy laws could be more burdensome on small companies than tech giants like Facebook and Google. Noah Phillips, another Republican commissioner, cautioned that Congress and the agency needed to define what the legislation should achieve. “We first have to figure out what problem needs to be solved,” Mr. Phillips said in an interview during a break at the hearing. After the hearing, Mr. Simons said he was open to naming individuals in privacy orders, but it depended on the circumstances. “If you start naming people as a regular thing you will end up with lots more litigation, which means it’s a lot more resource-intensive and you will bring fewer cases and get fewer settlements,” he said. Representative Kathy Castor, Democrat of Florida, was among lawmakers on Wednesday who pushed for the agency to seek higher financial penalties and stronger business restraints against tech companies that violate user privacy. Ms. Castor pointed to the recent record-setting child privacy settlement against TikTok, a video-sharing app. The F.T.C. reached a $5.7 million settlement with the company, formerly known as Musical.ly. The company is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese internet conglomerate. “I don’t think the fine fits the crime,” Ms. Castor said. “No C.E.O. is going to blink an eye” at that kind of penalty, she said. But Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, the top Republican of the committee, warned about expanding the F.T.C.’s capabilities too far. The agency should not, she said, “be transformed from a law-enforcement agency to a massive rule-making regime.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/business/ftc-hearing-facebook.html,business,The New York Times

Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. A deepening U.S. divide, Chinese crackdown’s surprise target, Banksy’s expensive prank. Here’s what you need to know: • Remaking the U.S. Supreme Court, at a cost. Against the backdrop of bitter protests, Judge Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed to the country’s highest court by one of the slimmest margins in history, putting the last of three branches of the U.S. government under conservative control. The partisan battle over his elevation widened as accusations of sexual misconduct tapped fury over #MeToo and white privilege, a conflagration that deeply eroded the court’s apolitical image. Next: Will Democratic rage dominate congressional midterms, just a month away? We have a guide with everything you need to know about the elections. And our newsletter Abroad in America helps make sense of what’s going on in Washington. _____ • Even Interpol is no shield from China. Meng Hongwei, the Interpol president who was reported missing after leaving France for China, is being investigated for “violating the law,” the country’s anti-corruption watchdog said. Hours later, Interpol announced that Mr. Meng, above, had resigned. What he did is not clear, but this is: Global prominence will not stay Beijing’s hand. Across the border, Hong Kong declined to renew the visa of the Financial Times Asia news editor, Victor Mallet, which will lead to his expulsion. The move came after Mr. Mallet drew the ire of Chinese officials by hosting, as vice president of the Foreign Correspondents’ Club, a talk with the pro-independence advocate Andy Chan. While Beijing has denied visas for foreign journalists, this is the first time Hong Kong has done so. Human rights activists warned of a deterioration of free speech and China’s increased interference in the semiautonomous city. _____ • The perils for Afghan women. This weekend was 17 years since the U.S. went to war in Afghanistan. The conflict’s efficacy and lasting impact provides plenty of debate fodder in the West. In Afghanistan, dozens of people were killed just in the last 24 hours, underscoring the war’s grinding toll. The country is also still wrestling with complex security and cultural questions. One example: Evidence shows that when women are involved in the security sector, nations enjoy a more stable, lasting peace. But only about 1.4 percent of Afghan security forces are women, pictured above. They are widely frowned upon, even referred to as “whores.” And predators find many ways of stalking women. Because infertility is often blamed on them, a con man found his opening — going around the country for years claiming he could “cure” them with sex. He filmed the encounters and then blackmailed the women. He is now on the run — and the women suspected of having fallen for his scheme are turning up dead. _____ • A pastor in Australia faces drought. “We pray for your mercy in sending soaking rain that really replenishes the land and restores the country.” So prays the Rev. Bernard Gabbott, above, who came to the small town of Wee Waa a decade ago to bring people to Jesus. Today, as the worst drought in decades continues to wither a vast tract of rural Australia, he has become a counselor, a social worker and a philanthropist — facing changing weather and trying to keep one community from falling apart. _____ _____ • China’s agricultural industry is undergoing a monumental shift. Small family farms are leasing their lands for others to work, planting the seeds for bigger commercial farms that could boost the economy. • China’s central bank is cutting the amount that some lenders must hold in reserve, effectively pumping $174 billion into the economy. The move signals worries about slowing growth and increased pressures from the trade war with the U.S. • Asia’s high demand for sea cucumbers has turned the unglamorous creatures into “black gold” for fishers, endangering the species and threatening to disrupt underwater ecosystems. • “Venom,” starring Tom Hardy as a fanged antihero, and the bittersweet romance “A Star Is Born,” this time with Lady Gaga in the lead role, vastly exceeded expectations, sending the North American box office to an October record. • Coming this week: Google’s new products, the Nobel Prize in Economics and bank earnings will all be announced over the next few days. • Here’s a snapshot of global markets. The Tokyo stock market is closed today. • Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that he had a “good, productive conversation” with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, and that a second U.S.-North Korea summit would come soon. Above, Mr. Pompeo with South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in. [The New York Times] • The Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who had been critical of his country’s leaders, was most likely killed at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkish officials said, sharply escalating tensions between the two countries. [The New York Times] • Tanushree Dutta, a former Miss India, filed a police complaint accusing the prominent actor Nana Patekar of sexually assaulting her on a movie set 10 years ago.

The New York show sold out, further illuminating the group’s success. • Cuisine ingrained in DNA: The largest-scale genetic study to date of the Chinese population found genes catering to the metabolism of a kaleidoscopic range of foods, from the meat-heavy stews in the north to fresh greens in the south. • In case you missed it: A framed artwork by Banksy, the renowned street artist, self-destructed immediately after it sold for $1.4 million at Sotheby’s. “We’ve been Banksy-ed,” said the auction house. And now the prices for his work look set to soar. A key date in feline history just slunk past. On Oct. 7, 1982, the musical “Cats” opened on Broadway, little more than a year after its debut in London’s West End. Scored by Andrew Lloyd Webber, the show had a script drawn from a playful volume of poetry, T.S. Eliot’s “Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats.” It told a loose story about “Jellicle” cats gathered for a junkyard ball. The New York show received mixed reviews (“Whatever the other failings and excesses, even banalities, of ‘Cats,’” Frank Rich wrote in The Times, “it believes in purely theatrical magic”). But it ran for 18 years, earning nearly $400 million. A revival in 2016 ran for about a year and a half. Above, Mr. Lloyd Webber with that cast. Next stop: Hollywood. In December 2019, “Cats” makes its movie debut, with Steven Spielberg and Mr. Lloyd Webber executive producing. Shooting starts in Britain next month; James Corden, Jennifer Hudson, Ian McKellen and Taylor Swift are among those slated to prowl the screen. “I think the key to the ‘Cats’ movie is going to be: What do they look like?” Mr. Lloyd Webber said last year. “I think that you can’t do ‘Cats’ with a great deal of C.G.I.,” he added. “Part of the thing is seeing that they are human beings.” Nancy Wartik wrote today’s Back Story. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.

110,2018-11-27 05:00:01,2018,11.0,27,Winnie Hu,"In This Corner of New York City, It’s Gray-Haired Pedestrians vs. Bikes","A tiny wedge of a park on the East Side of Manhattan is a haven for the older people who fill its benches and often park walking canes and wheelchairs beside them. “You don’t feel like you’re in the middle of the city,” said Marjorie Posner, 77, a retired financial manager and park regular. “It’s an escape from the noise and the bicycles.” But soon the bicycles will be coming. As part of an ambitious plan to complete an unbroken bike-and-pedestrian path around Manhattan, city officials plan to install a ramp alongside the park that would give access to a new esplanade on the East River. Longtime parkgoers are furious. And their anger reflects a broader debate about a cycling boom sweeping New York that is increasingly leading to conflict with another trend — the city’s growing number of older residents, many of whom say they cannot dodge bikes fast enough. “When you’re walking the street, and you’re trying to cross it, and there are bicycles coming all over the place, it’s a scary thing,” William Robertson, 62, a writer and filmmaker, said. “You can’t just jump out of the way like a gazelle like you did in your 20s.” Cycling has increasingly emerged as an alternative to the city’s troubled subways and buses, and as a way to help reduce car congestion on already crowded streets. It allows riders to go where they want, when they want, without being limited by routes and schedules. And it offers the benefit of exercise and fresh air. About 460,000 bike rides take place in the city every day, up from about 180,000 bike rides in 2006, according to the city. There are now 1,208 miles of bike lanes, 268 of which have been added since 2014. But in recent years, the growing bike presence has drawn complaints from residents and community leaders who say that some cyclists ignore traffic rules and pose a safety hazard to pedestrians. Cyclists, in turn, have countered that pedestrians often walk in bike lanes, or dart in front of them with little warning. Gale Brewer, the Manhattan borough president, said that while she supports cycling in the city, she hears complaints every time she visits a senior center about dangerous cyclists who ride too fast, run red lights, go in the wrong direction and cross over onto the sidewalks. “It’s a huge concern,” she said. “They’re older and they can’t move as fast. They say to me all the time, ‘I almost got hit by a bike.’” Mary Dodd, 64, said she recently had two close calls with cyclists while crossing First Avenue on the Upper East Side. Both times, she said she looked toward oncoming traffic before crossing. And both times, she said she was nearly flattened by cyclists speeding from the opposite direction against traffic. Ms. Dodd, the director of the social services unit for the Carter Burden Network, a community-based social service agency, said she’s heard many stories of older people having near misses. “I’m terrified of bikes,” she said. “I always feel that’s how I’m going to end my days. I’ve had so many close calls.” Still, pedestrians are far more likely to be killed by cars than bikes. A 63-year-old man on the Lower East Side was killed last year in a crash with a cyclist who did not end up being charged with a crime. It was the first time a cyclist had killed a pedestrian since crashes in consecutive months in 2014 in Central Park killed a 75-year-old jogger from Manhattan’s Upper East Side and a 58-year-old Connecticut woman, according to city records. Another 315 pedestrians were injured last year in 365 crashes with cyclists, about half of which took place in Manhattan. But those figures are dwarfed by the 107 pedestrians who were killed in motor vehicle crashes last year and the more than 10,500 other pedestrians who were injured. “The small risk from bicycles pales in comparison to the deadly risk from cars and trucks,” said Marco Conner, deputy director of Transportation Alternatives, an advocacy group that promotes initiatives to make streets safer. “There is a false picture that has been painted of cyclists pitted against pedestrians, whereas both cyclists and pedestrians are vulnerable road users.” The new East River esplanade is one of the final pieces in a more than two-decade effort to create a 32.5-mile bicycle and pedestrian circuit around Manhattan, known as the Manhattan Waterfront Greenway. The esplanade, which will cost $100 million, will run between East 53rd and East 61st streets. A bridge connecting to the esplanade will be built at the eastern end of 54th Street and run over the F.D.R. Drive. The ramp to the bridge will cut through a corner of Clara Coffey Park in Sutton Place, where residents are more accustomed to seeing wheelchairs than bikes. As a result, more cyclists are expected to pass in front of the park’s entrance. “Closing the gaps along the Manhattan Waterfront Greenway will provide a seamless connection to world-class open space and will help make our city more accessible and equitable,” said Stephanie Báez, a spokeswoman for the New York City Economic Development Corporation, which is leading the project. Ms. Báez said officials have been responding to community concerns, and “the design will provide safe access for bicyclists, pedestrians and those looking to enjoy peace and tranquillity on the East River waterfront.” The bridge and esplanade will be accessible to people with disabilities, she said. Under the current plan, 50 percent of the esplanade will be designed for pedestrians compared with 35 percent for cyclists (15 percent will be shared space). Perry Pazer, 87, a retired lawyer who lives in Sutton Place, said he looked forward to being able to walk along the riverfront instead of on the street. “It’s a place for us elderly people to get exercise,” he said. But many residents are against the project, saying that bringing more bikes to their neighborhood will turn even routine trips into a frightening obstacle course. The city has secured some but not all of the approvals for the project, which is on track to begin construction next year. Some opponents say the new bridge and esplanade will primarily benefit people who are younger, physically fit or active, and not a neighborhood filled with older residents. About 61 percent of Sutton Place residents are over the age of 55, compared with roughly 24 percent citywide, according to an analysis of census data by Social Explorer, a research company. They also say the project will take away precious open space from a park that is only .85 acres, and partly block the sunlight and sweeping views of the East River. Board members of nearby co-op buildings have formed a group to stop the bridge. James P. Donovan, the group’s president, said it would “pursue all available options.” Sheldon Fried, 85, a retired lawyer who uses a walking cane, said he may have to stop going to the park. “I wouldn’t like to dodge bicycles because I might fall,” he said. Residents have also questioned whether the $100 million could be better spent on more pressing needs, such as fixing the subways or helping the homeless. Others have called the project “a bridge to nowhere” because there would still be a gap just south of the new esplanade behind the United Nations. There is currently no funding yet to fill the gap, but the city has said it intends to complete this section. Supporters of the esplanade have dismissed the objections as simply not-in-my-backyard opposition. David Halle, 71, a sociology professor at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York and a cyclist, said that crossing the entrance to the new bridge would be no more dangerous than crossing the bike lanes on nearby First Avenue. “It’s no different, they look left and right, and they cross,” he said. “They’re being selfish. They’re not willing to make a contribution to the general welfare of the neighborhood and the city.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/27/nyregion/elderly-pedestrians-bicycles-accidents.html,nyregion,The New York Times
111,2019-08-09 16:30:32,2019,8.0,9,Dan Bilefsky,Finding Lessons on Multiculturalism in the Experiences of Sikh Canadians,"Hi, this is Dan Bilefsky. I am writing this week’s Canada Letter while Ian Austen is on vacation at his cottage in Ontario. Since returning to Canada about two years ago, after 28 years abroad, I have been struck by our relative embrace of minorities. In my previous home in Europe, populism is bubbling, along with calls in some quarters for immigrants to assimilate — or go home. In Canada, one group vividly embodying the “Canadian Dream” is the Sikh community, which I recently got to know better while reporting a profile of Jagmeet Singh, a practicing Sikh, who is hoping to unseat Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the upcoming national election. While Mr. Singh faces an uphill struggle, the rise of the Sikh community as a political force in Canada is nevertheless remarkable, and all the more so given the initial chilly reception Sikh immigrants received here. In the spring of 1914, a steamship carrying 376 Punjabi migrants, a majority of them Sikhs, had arrived at the Port of Vancouver. After a tense two-month standoff, the British Columbia Regiment sent the ship, the Komagata Maru, back to India, where 20 Sikhs were shot dead by Indian imperial forces. This history came up when I talked with Canada’s defense minister, Harjit Sajjan. He said that when he became Commanding Officer of the storied British Columbia Regiment some years ago, it was an emotional moment for him, the Sikh son of a Punjabi sawmill worker. Mr. Sajjan called the Sikhs’ evolution from pariahs to government ministers a “very Canadian story.” “It shows that Canada is a country where people are judged by what they can offer — not by how they look or their ethnicity,” he said. Nevertheless, Canada’s immigration minister, Ahmed Hussen, recently warned that in an election year, the political consensus in favor of immigration was fraying amid scaremongering that Canada was too open to immigrants. In June, in a move to enshrine secularism, the right-leaning government of Premier François Legault of Quebec passed a law banning teachers, judges, police and other government workers from wearing religious symbols like Muslim headscarves or Sikh turbans at work. Under the law, Mr. Sajjan, who emigrated to Canada at age 5 and made a name for himself as a police officer fighting gang crime in Vancouver, would not be allowed to serve as a police officer in Quebec unless he took off his turban. The rise of the Sikh community is in many ways a powerful argument for Canada’s model of multiculturalism. Although Canada has only about 500,000 Sikhs, accounting for a little more than 1 percent of all Canadians, there are four Sikhs in Mr. Trudeau’s cabinet, including Mr. Sajjan, and 18 Sikh members of Parliament, out of 338 seats, according to the World Sikh Organization. Mr. Trudeau has boasted that he has more Sikhs in his cabinet than does India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi. Many Sikhs encountered racism after arriving in Canada to work as laborers, and some recalled being told to take off their turbans or risk losing out on promotion. Mr. Sajjan said that when he joined the military in 1989, and several superiors told him his turban and religion could get in the way, he thought of quitting. “But my father said if you quit now, other minorities who look different will be labeled a failure.” He stayed and graduated top of his class. Over tea at his house in Vancouver, Ujjal Dosanjh, a former premier and attorney general of British Columbia, who rose from mill worker to become a federal minister of health, told me that, as a boy in India, he was not allowed to cut his hair — one of the five K’s, or symbols of faith, that baptized Sikhs are expected to wear at all times. By the time he emigrated to Canada in the early 1970s, he had removed his turban. “The vast majority of Sikhs of my generation took off their turbans and shaved their beards in order to fit in here.” Mr. Dosanjh said the community’s worst moment came on June 23, 1985, when an Air India flight traveling from Toronto to India exploded in the air, killing 331 people. The worst mass murder in Canadian history, the attack was planned from Vancouver by a group of Sikh separatists led by a preacher, Talwinder Singh Parmar. “Air India made other Canadians feel that all who had turbans and beards were terrorists,” Mr. Dosanjh said, warning against the perils of extremism. He also stressed that “the violent eruptions in the Sikh community were a vocal fringe.” As the Sikh community has prospered, Betty Hayer, a community activist, said her generation felt more confident about their Sikh identity than some of their parents. “Our mom got married in a white gown,” she said. “I got married in a sari.” Trans Canada — After a weekslong manhunt through the remote wilderness of Manitoba, the Canadian police announced this week that they had found the bodies of two teenagers suspected in the murder of three people. — In August, Netflix Canada begins streaming new films and television shows. Among the highlights is “Otherhood,” in which three suburban mothers go to New York to straighten out their adult sons’ chaotic lives.

112,2019-02-27 19:22:51,2019,2.0,27,Michelle Cottle,Opinion | Michael Cohen Has a Lot of Regrets,"He said working for Donald Trump was “intoxicating.” We’re all feeling hung over. Ms. Cottle is a member of the editorial board. “Liar, liar, pants on fire!” It was Representative Paul Gosar, Republican of Arizona, who burst forth with this playground taunt of Michael Cohen, the longtime fixer and personal lawyer for President Trump who appeared Wednesday before the House Oversight and Reform Committee to talk about his former boss. But Mr. Gosar’s observation was more than an isolated zinger; it was an encapsulation of his party’s overarching approach to Mr. Cohen’s testimony. It also provides a pretty good sense of how few minds the hearing is likely to change in this era of bitter polarization — and how tough it can be to bring any clarity to the swirl of controversies engulfing this president. As that spectacle was opening in Washington, 12 time zones away, in Hanoi, the president was wrapping up a friendly dinner with Kim Jong-un, the tyrannical leader of North Korea. Mr. Trump hopes that the pageantry of peacemaking in Asia will overshadow the damaging testimony of the former confidant he has written off as a lying “rat.” We await the results of Mr. Trump’s and Mr. Kim’s negotiations. We hope that they are more edifying than the House hearings. Oh, and India and Pakistan — both possessed of nuclear weapons — were engaged in escalating hostilities, including the downing of two Indian warplanes on Wednesday. This is the world we live in. On Capitol Hill, committee Republicans did not waste their time disputing Mr. Cohen’s characterization of Mr. Trump as “a racist,” “a con man” and “a cheat.” At one point, Representative Mark Meadows asked Lynne Patton, an African-American woman who worked for the Trump family as a party planner and now serves in the administration, to stand behind him, citing her as proof that the president cannot possibly be racist. That’s about as substantive as the pushback got. Instead, Republicans stuck to discrediting and vivisecting the witness. Member after member detailed Mr. Cohen’s financial fraud, his tax evasion, his professional disloyalty and, of course, his previous lies to Congress. The committee’s ranking Republican, Jim Jordan — in high-dudgeon and dangerously over-caffeinated — seemed particularly troubled by the origins and authenticity of a Twitter account, Women for Cohen, that pushed out ridiculous flattery about Mr. Cohen’s manliness: #sexy! #handsome! Message: Mr. Cohen is a liar, a “swindler,” a narcissist and a felon whom only a fool would listen to. Multiple Republicans, in fact, went on at length about what a disgrace it was that Democrats had provided a platform for such a scoundrel. While quibbling with details here and there, Mr. Cohen did not disagree with the Republicans’ critique. Early and often, he acknowledged he had done some bad things for which he soon would be spending time in prison. He did, however, at one point feel moved to observe to Mr. Jordan: “I just find it interesting, sir, that between yourself and your colleagues, that not one question so far … has been asked about President Trump. That’s actually why I thought I was coming today.” Aware of his credibility problems, Mr. Cohen showed up with hard proof of Trumpian misdeeds: a personal check from the president, allegedly used to reimburse Mr. Cohen for his payment to Stormy Daniels; evidence that Mr. Trump arranged to have a portrait of himself purchased at a charity auction by a straw buyer, who was then repaid through Mr. Trump’s charitable foundation; and letters that Mr. Trump had instructed Mr. Cohen to write, warning the president’s high school, colleges and the College Board not to release his grades or test scores without his permission. Mr. Cohen noted that threatening people on Mr. Trump’s behalf was an integral part of his job, estimating that, over a decade, he was called upon to do so around 500 times. The whole dreary spectacle produced only a few fresh tidbits — such as Mr. Cohen’s claim that Mr. Trump, a year into his term, explicitly directed him to lie about the president’s involvement in the hush-money scheme — none of which seem likely to alter the competing narratives being pushed by the president’s critics and allies. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Democrat’s star freshman, laid the groundwork for demanding the president’s tax returns and issuing future subpoenas to more Trump lackeys. Mr. Cohen suggested that federal prosecutors in New York are investigating as-yet-unrevealed Trumpian crimes. He also ominously fretted: “I fear that if he loses the election in 2020 that there will never be a peaceful transition of power.” Mr. Cohen said that working for Mr. Trump was “intoxicating.” But something has changed. Mr. Cohen’s performance is likely the first of many such soul-barings to play out in hearing rooms and courtrooms over coming months. “I regret the day I said ‘yes’ to Mr. Trump,” he said. “I regret all the help and support I gave him along the way.” The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

He was 31. Astori, a defender and captain of the Fiorentina team, was discovered by team staff members when he failed to show up for breakfast. The team was scheduled to play in Udine, in northeast Italy, later in the day. “The belief is that the player died of a cardiac arrest by natural causes,” the Udine prosecutor, Antonio De Nicolo, said. “It is strange that such a thing should happen to a professional who is so closely monitored without there being any warning signs.” Italian soccer has more stringent rules and tests than many other countries. Professional athletes in Italy are required to undergo some examinations every six months. “Risk of sudden death goes right down with all the checks, but you can’t avoid it completely,” said Carlo Tranquilli, a specialist in sports medicine and a former doctor for Italy’s under-21 team. Astori was born on Jan. 7, 1987, in San Giovanni Bianco, on the river Brembo in northern Italy. Survivors include his companion, Francesca Fioretti; their 2-year-old daughter, Vittoria; and his parents. In Florence, fans attached scarves, flowers and messages to the gates of the team’s stadium, while banners paying tribute to him were put up outside several other stadiums. “I’m shocked, it’s an absurd tragedy,” said Giovanni Malago, the president of Italy’s national Olympic committee. “The football world is deeply affected by what has happened.” Diego Lopez, who played and coached Astori at the Sardinian club and is the coach of the Cagliari team, had to receive medical treatment after learning the news, as did Carlos Sanchez, who is on loan from Fiorentina at Espanyol. Astori made his Italian debut in 2011 and played at the 2013 Confederations Cup in Brazil, where he scored against Uruguay. He spent six years at the Sardinian club before being lent to Roma and Fiorentina, where he was signed on a permanent basis in 2016. An earlier version of this obituary misidentified Francesca Fioretti, who is among Astori’s survivors. She was his companion, not his wife. Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this obituary misspelled the name of the team now coached by Diego Lopez, a former coach of Astori’s. It is Cagliari, not Caligari.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/04/obituaries/davide-astori-dead.html,obituaries,The New York Times

115,2018-04-03 15:48:35,2018,4.0,3,Matt Apuzzo,Looking for Justice in the Building That Bears Its Name,"Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times. WASHINGTON — In the halls of the Justice Department, regardless of which party is in power, the refrain is always the same. Officials like to say that, unlike at other government agencies, their mission is right there in the name. But I’ve covered the Justice Department under five attorneys general from both parties, and it’s never as simple as that. Each attorney general has strong views about what it means to do justice. Questions of justice animate New York Times readers, too. I rarely get emails or calls about stories on Wall Street swindles or thwarted terrorism plots. But stories about whether terrorism suspects deserve lawyers? Or whether financial fraudsters are getting the kid glove treatment? Those strike at our sense of fairness, and the messages pour in. I remember sitting across from Eric H. Holder Jr. in his fifth-floor office as he argued that state prosecutors should consider refusing to defend bans on gay marriage. I knew immediately that it was a controversial statement (he knew it, too). The story set off a debate over whether this was an act of justice and fairness or a politicization of the department. On Wednesday, April 4, I will talk with Sally Q. Yates, the former acting attorney general, at a Times Insider event at Georgetown University. Ms. Yates is probably best known for being fired for refusing to enforce President Trump’s travel ban. She has described it as a moment “when the law and conscience intersected.” These moments, when we see the personal convictions behind the bureaucracy, bring the Justice Department beat to life. They can be dramatic: John Ashcroft’s resistance, from his hospital bed, to White House meddling, comes to mind. But sometimes they are clearest only in hindsight. Michael B. Mukasey promised to stabilize and depoliticize the department, and he is still highly regarded among career officials who say he meant it. I look for stories that surprise. Jeff Sessions, who has reversed civil rights protections for gay and transgender people, dispatched a hate-crimes prosecutor to Iowa last year over the murder of a transgender teenager. I got angry emails from people who said the story gave Mr. Sessions too much credit, but reporters are not in the business of handing out credits and demerits. Mr. Sessions is carrying out one of the sharpest U-turns in Justice Department philosophy in modern history. Times reporters have chronicled his reversals on civil rights, marijuana policy, immigration and more. If we do our job well, readers should get a sense of why these policies are taking shape. Often these issues do not break along party lines, which make them interesting in a city where today’s battle lines are so clear. One small example: Ms. Yates pushed for more lenient sentencing laws and an expanded educational system in federal prison. Mr. Sessions is adamantly opposed. But another of her signature decisions was ordering prosecutors not to go easy on Wall Street executives. That fits neatly with Mr. Sessions’s philosophy. “I was taught, if they violated the law, you charge them,” he said in 2010. The politics of law enforcement are as murky now as ever. In the 1980s and 1990s, both parties united in the face of the crack epidemic to pass strict laws and mandatory minimum sentences. President Bill Clinton signed a bipartisan crime bill in 1994 that toughened sentences and paid for more prisons. As a cub reporter in New Bedford, Mass., I covered the cops in a city surrounded by heroin addiction. My editor rightly saw it as the paper’s job to question the local government’s response. The result was a steady drumbeat of stories and editorials about the district attorney’s reluctance to use laws that would prompt mandatory minimum sentences. My editor was a Massachusetts liberal, hardly a law-and-order hard-liner. Like so many people, he was simply at his wit’s end. When prison populations soared — a trend that disproportionately affected young African-American men — politicians began reconsidering their policies. Mr. Clinton said his law went too far. And Mr. Holder found common ground with libertarian-minded Republicans who say long prison sentences are an ineffective and expensive way to fight crime. Conservative states like Texas have helped lead a criminal justice reform movement. Mr. Sessions is not having it. He cut his teeth as a prosecutor during the 1980s, and he credits that era’s laws with lowering crime nationwide. I recently wrote about how his views have put him at odds with Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and adviser. The politics are changing around Mr. Sessions, but he retains the views of justice and fairness that he has held for decades. For many conservatives, that makes him a man of principle. For many liberals, that makes him dangerous. For me, that makes for a great story.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/03/insider/matt-apuzzo-sally-yates-covering-five-attorneys-general.html,insider,The New York Times
116,2018-03-23 14:09:25,2018,3.0,23,Aurelien Breeden,Nicolas Sarkozy and the Libya Investigation: The Key Questions,"PARIS — Nicolas Sarkozy, the flamboyant former French president who had hoped to revive his political career, is facing a formal investigation over allegations that his 2007 campaign received illegal funding from the Libyan strongman Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. It is not certain that Mr. Sarkozy, who led France from 2007 to 2012 but failed to generate enough enthusiasm in his 2016 comeback bid, will stand trial. But the decision by investigators to pursue the case represents a significant step and means that a return to the political stage is even more unlikely for Mr. Sarkozy. Mr. Sarkozy acknowledged as much on Thursday, saying in a television interview, “Politics, that’s over.” Here are some answers to the central questions about the case. After two days of questioning by the police, Mr. Sarkozy, 63, who has been the subject of several corruption inquiries, was formally charged with passive corruption, illegal campaign financing and misappropriation of Libyan public funds. (The charge of passive corruption applies to people suspected of receiving money or favors.) The case was opened in 2013, after a 2012 report by the investigative news website Mediapart suggesting that Mr. Sarkozy’s campaign had received up to 50 million euros, or nearly $62 million at current exchange rates, from Colonel Qaddafi’s government. Investigators have been proceeding slowly, and their inquiries had featured in the news only sporadically. The case files are sealed, and several of the Libyans said to have played a role are dead or exiled, making it hard to piece together a fully accurate picture of the investigation. It involves a complex web of political and financial ties between Mr. Sarkozy’s advisers, officials who were part of Colonel Qaddafi’s government before he was ousted, and figures who played a murky role as intermediaries between the two as relations between France and Libya warmed up in the mid-2000s. The accusations stem mostly from former Libyan officials and a Franco-Lebanese arms dealer named Ziad Takieddine, who acted as an intermediary and who says he personally delivered millions in cash. One official, a former oil minister for Colonel Qaddafi named Shukri Ghanem — whose body was found in the Danube in Vienna in 2012 — left behind documents that refer to payments made to Mr. Sarkozy in 2007. The officials, and Mr. Takieddine, have given conflicting accounts about the sequence of events and the amounts of money involved. Some Libyan officials have even denied that Mr. Sarkozy’s campaign received any funding. A report by investigators cited in the French news media appears to have established that Mr. Sarkozy’s 2007 campaign had unusual amounts of cash on hand — one of Mr. Sarkozy’s top aides rented a large bank vault during the campaign, ostensibly to store documents and speeches. But the sums mentioned were in the range of tens of thousands of euros, not millions. Still, the fact that the French magistrates investigating the case have decided to place Mr. Sarkozy under formal investigation suggests they that there is evidence of potential wrongdoing, even if the exact scope and nature remain unclear. Mr. Sarkozy has continually and strenuously denied the accusations, calling them “grotesque.” In a Thursday night interview on the French television channel TF1, he said that he had “never betrayed the trust” of the French people. “There is not one document, not one picture, not one account, not one piece of material proof. There is only hatred, mud, mediocrity, malevolence and slander.” — Mr. Sarkozy, in an interview with French television. He called Mr. Takieddine “sinister” and “unbalanced.” Noting that many of the accusations came from former Libyan officials, Mr. Sarkozy disparaged Colonel Qaddafi and his aides as “assassins” and “criminals” who could not be trusted. He argued that the accusations were driven by a desire by allies of Colonel Qaddafi to seek revenge against Mr. Sarkozy. France, under his leadership, played a prominent role in the NATO-led campaign of airstrikes that ultimately led to the toppling of Colonel Qaddafi and his death at the hands of Libyan rebels in 2011. In France, complex criminal cases are handled by special magistrates with broad investigative powers, who place defendants under formal investigation when they believe the evidence points to serious wrongdoing. This means that the investigation will continue for several months, if not longer. Mr. Sarkozy’s conduct will be restricted as the magistrates do their work — a first for a former president in recent French history. He has been forbidden to meet with several people of interest in the case, including two close allies who have also come under scrutiny, and he is barred from traveling to a handful of countries, including Libya. Mr. Sarkozy’s lawyer said on Friday that he would appeal the restrictions. But Mr. Sarkozy will not necessarily stand trial when the investigation ends. The magistrates can drop the charges if they do not believe the evidence is sufficient to proceed. Even if the judges order Mr. Sarkozy to stand trial, he can still appeal the decision. Mr. Sarkozy has been dogged by accusations of financial impropriety since he left the presidency. That has hampered his ability to make a political comeback, despite his popularity with the base of his party. He has been ordered to stand trial in two other cases. In the first, involving his 2012 campaign, he has been charged with exceeding strict limits on campaign spending. In the second, he is accused of trying to obtain confidential information from a court judge. Other cases against Mr. Sarkozy have been dropped, including one in which we was accused of manipulating the heiress to the L’Oréal fortune into financing his 2007 campaign.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/world/europe/nicolas-sarkozy.html,world,The New York Times
117,2018-03-07 19:15:04,2018,3.0,7,Adam Liptak,Sessions Targets California Immigrants Using a Ruling That Protected Them,"WASHINGTON — Attorney General Jeff Sessions sued California this week for not doing enough to find and punish unauthorized immigrants, and said on Wednesday he was girding for an epic battle. “California is using every power it has — and some it doesn’t — to frustrate federal law enforcement,” he said in a speech in Sacramento. “So you can be sure I’m going to use every power I have to stop them.” One of the weapons Mr. Sessions is counting on is a 2012 Supreme Court ruling siding with the Obama administration, which had sued Arizona for violating federal immigration laws. But in that case Mr. Obama’s lawyers accused the state of going too far in trying to find and punish unauthorized immigrants. “The state may not pursue policies that undermine federal law,” Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the majority. So it may turn out that the principle of federal supremacy over immigration established by the Obama administration will help the Trump Justice Department achieve diametrically different goals. “The tables are turned,” said Peter J. Spiro, a law professor at Temple University. The California case seems likely to reach the Supreme Court, where it could give rise to a landmark reckoning on the role of states in setting immigration policy. In the process, state and federal officials, along with judges and justices, will face a test of their commitment to consistency. They will face stark choices. One is to apply legal principles established in a case that mostly protected immigrants to one that seeks to imperil them. Another is to revise those principles in light of the very different circumstances. Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas, said history was repeating itself, but backward. “The suit is modeled on the Obama administration’s successful suit against Arizona,” he said. But he added that “some of the key considerations are flipped.” In the Arizona case, conservatives insisted that respect for state sovereignty required letting states play a leading role in controlling immigration within their borders. But Mr. Sessions, a longtime conservative himself, disavowed that position in his speech on Wednesday. “Immigration law is the province of the federal government,” he said. Justice Antonin Scalia, the conservative jurist who died in 2016, took a different view of the Arizona case. In an impassioned partial dissent, he wrote that “it is easy to lose sight of the states’ traditional role in regulating immigration — and to overlook their sovereign prerogative to do so.” There is no doubt that the California lawsuit is at odds with some of the Trump administration’s usual positions. “It’s a fascinating suit on a number of levels,” Professor Vladeck said, “not the least of which is the aggressive assertion of federal enforcement power directly against states by those, like Attorney General Sessions, who have historically been ardent defenders of states’ rights in the deeply analogous contexts.” Cristina Rodriguez, a law professor at Yale, said she detected political parallels between the two suits. “Both administrations claim that the state laws they challenge impermissibly interfere with the executive branch’s ability to enforce the immigration laws,” she said. “But both lawsuits are also clearly designed to take on visible and politically powerful local officials whose vision of immigration policy conflicts with the president’s and his supporters’.” In a news conference on Wednesday, Xavier Becerra, the California attorney general, said he was ready for the fight. The state’s laws, he said, were “fully constitutional and provide for the safety and welfare of all our people.” “California is in the business of public safety,” he said. “We are not in the business of deportations.” The Justice Department challenged parts of three of California’s so-called sanctuary laws. One restricts employers from cooperating with immigration officials. A second generally prohibits state officials from telling federal ones when undocumented immigrants are to be released from state custody. A third requires state officials to inspect some facilities that house people detained on behalf of the federal government. Jennifer Chacon, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, said the state laws had been carefully written to avoid direct conflicts with federal immigration laws. “I think it is clear that California deliberately tried to draft laws that involved core exercises of state police power in a way that did not run afoul of federal law,” she said. Each state law presents different issues, and courts may give varying answers depending on how directly the state laws conflict with federal ones. More generally, though, courts will take account of the Supreme Court’s decision in the Arizona case, which called for collaboration rather than conflict. “Consultation between federal and state officials is an important feature of the immigration system,” Justice Kennedy wrote in the court’s decision in the Arizona case. Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, has said that consultation is fine but that federal officials should not use California’s resources to pursue undocumented Californians. The federal government, he added, may do so on its own. “They are free to use their own considerable resources to enforce federal immigration law in California,” he said in October in signing one of the challenged laws. The Supreme Court has said that the federal government may not commandeer state resources to achieve federal objectives. In his speech on Wednesday, Mr. Sessions denied that anything like that was afoot. “Contrary to what you might hear from the lawless open borders radicals,” he said, “we are not asking California, Oakland or anyone else to enforce immigration laws.” “We are simply asking California and other sanctuary jurisdictions to stop actively obstructing federal law enforcement,” he added. But Professor Rodriguez said the commandeering issue was a substantial one. “To the extent the Trump administration’s claims against California would produce an outcome that would effectively force states and localities to participate in immigration enforcement,” she said, “there could be an unconstitutional commandeering.” Professor Spiro said that California may have the upper hand in the suit’s early stages, as the issues in it are novel, leaving judges with substantial discretion. The Trump administration has not fared well in federal courts in California in other cases concerning immigration, including ones challenging President Trump’s efforts to restrict travel from predominantly Muslim countries and to rescind a program protecting some 700,000 young unauthorized immigrants from deportation. But the ultimate fate of the suit will probably rest with the Supreme Court. In 2012, with what may have been unwarranted optimism, Justice Kennedy said he hoped that conflicts over immigration policy would be worked out through reasoned discussion. “The national government has significant power to regulate immigration,” he wrote. “The sound exercise of national power over immigration depends on the nation’s meeting its responsibility to base its laws on a political will informed by searching, thoughtful, rational civic discourse.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/07/us/politics/jeff-sessions-california-lawsuit.html,us,The New York Times

President Trump’s impeachment team is taking final shape. He tapped the former independent counsel Ken Starr, the celebrity lawyer Alan Dershowitz and several other prominent attorneys to join the group, which will be led by Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel, and Jay Sekulow, one of Mr. Trump’s personal lawyers. Mr. Trump initially wanted some of his favorite House Republicans, such as Jim Jordan, to be on the defense team, but Senator Mitch McConnell rejected the idea. Other advisers to Mr. Trump also expressed concerns about having members of the House involved. Mr. Trump’s defense team will be a collection of some of his favorite television personalities, several of his personal lawyers and the top White House lawyer. Here’s a look at who they are. Pat Cipollone: As White House counsel, Mr. Cipollone has been the legal brain behind Mr. Trump’s responses to the impeachment battle. In October he signed a blistering eight-page letter to top House Democrats arguing against cooperating with the impeachment inquiry. Viewed as a calmer version of his predecessor, Don McGahn, he is said to be more temperamentally agreeable to the president. [Read more.] Jay Sekulow: A frequent presence on Fox News and on Christian television, Mr. Sekulow is one of Mr. Trump’s longest-serving personal lawyers, and he coordinates a group of attorneys from a cooperative working space a few blocks from the White House. Mr. Sekulow also defended the president in Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. [Read more.] Ken Starr: Mr. Starr was a household name in the ’90s, after he led the investigation into President Bill Clinton that resulted in his impeachment for perjury and obstruction of justice. He and the president haven’t always been close: Mr. Trump told interviewers in 1999 that Mr. Starr was a “wacko” and a “lunatic.” But recently the president is said to have enjoyed watching him on television, where Mr. Starr has frequently defended and praised him.

I asked my colleagues Peter Baker and Maggie Haberman, who wrote today about the defense team. Peter, Ken Starr! What is this move about? PETER: Two words: Fox News. He sees Ken Starr defending him on TV. He also thinks, here’s a guy whose investigation led to the impeachment of the last president but thinks this impeachment is illegitimate. In Mr. Trump’s mind, who would have better credibility than him? Do the two have a relationship? PETER: Mr. Starr is not close to Mr. Trump in any way. He’s very different from Mr. Trump. And here’s the interesting thing: There are a lot of things in Mr. Trump that he didn’t like in Mr. Clinton — this raffish, undisciplined, morally suspect figure who in his view disgraced the Oval Office. Mr. Trump in some ways would touch off some of the same concerns, given his history with women and marriage and honesty. Do you think there’s any power in the symmetry of Mr. Starr going up against Democrats then and now? PETER: What his hiring reinforces is how so many people have simply flipped sides, depending on which political party is in which position, whether it be the Democrats who decried the witch hunt against their president 20 years ago and today talk very soberly about the rule of law, or the Republicans who 20 years ago talked about the rule of law and today talk about witch hunts. Maggie, how much of this is about television? MAGGIE: That’s a big part of it. He wants people he thinks are going to fight and be aggressive and “perform” well in a TV context. He wants them to look commanding. He wants people who he thinks can notch political victories, even if they’re incremental. How much is Mr. Trump himself organizing this effort? MAGGIE: I think Mr. Sekulow and Mr. Cipollone are the ones thinking about what roles people actually play. And they’re thinking about this in a pretty comprehensive way — for example, Mr. Dershowitz is coming in for a pretty narrow part, and just for next week. But they’re in consultation with Mr. Trump on these choices. He’s very involved in all of this.

119,2020-01-13 03:00:07,2020,1.0,13,Andrew Ross Sorkin,"Away C.E.O. Is Back, Just Weeks After Stepping Down","Former employees of the luggage start-up told a tech website that Steph Korey had created a toxic culture. She stepped aside. But now, she says that was a mistake. She apologized for her management style and stepped down as chief executive. Now, she says it was a mistake to fall on her sword and is taking her job back. Former employees of Away luggage, one of the fastest-growing retail start-ups in recent years, accused the company’s chief executive, Steph Korey, of creating a toxic culture within the company in an article published by the technology website The Verge that went viral last month. The article included text messages that a Verge editor described on Twitter as showing Ms. Korey using the workplace messaging application Slack “as a tool to stalk and bully junior and minority employees.” In the article, former employees — who were identified by pseudonyms — contended that Ms. Korey pushed them too hard. In one message quoted in the article, which was sent at 3 a.m., she told employees on the customer service team that they could not work from home or submit vacation requests until customer service problems she had identified were resolved. In others, she came across as passive-aggressive. Within hours of its publication, the article had created a social media firestorm around the company, which is worth more than $1 billion in the private market with plans to go public. For a company focused on a millennial audience and a brand that seeks to evoke a sense of community, the story was viewed internally as existential. Within 24 hours, Ms. Korey had issued a lengthy apology. “I am sincerely sorry for what I said and how I said it. It was wrong, plain and simple,” she said. “I can imagine how people felt reading those messages from the past, because I was appalled to read them myself,” she wrote. Days later, the company said that it was hiring a new chief executive and that Ms. Korey would become executive chairwoman. The episode, the latest example of a fast-growing company run by young founders that has found itself in a crisis, was viewed within the insular world of start-ups as a swift fall for Ms. Korey, Away’s 31-year-old co-founder. The new chief executive, Stuart Haselden, plans to start his job on Monday, having been recruited from Lululemon Athletica, the company famous for its leggings. But there is one new, significant wrinkle: His title won’t be chief executive — he will be co-chief executive with Ms. Korey. She isn’t going anywhere. The company plans to announce the move on Monday morning. “Frankly, we let some inaccurate reporting influence the timeline of a transition plan that we had,” Ms. Korey said in an interview last week. With some time and perspective, she said, the company’s board members decided to reverse themselves. “All of us said, ‘It’s not right.’” The members of Away’s board say they feel as if they fell victim to management by Twitter mob. The company now says it disputes The Verge’s reporting and has hired Elizabeth M. Locke, the lawyer who successfully brought a defamation case against Rolling Stone magazine for a story about a supposed gang rape at the University of Virginia. It is unclear whether Away plans to bring a lawsuit. In a statement, The Verge said, “Steph Korey responding to our reporting by saying her behavior and comments were ‘wrong, plain and simple’ and then choosing to step down as C.E.O. speaks for itself.” Sitting in a windowless conference room at the company’s SoHo headquarters, Ms. Korey, at one point nearly breaking down in tears, said that the month since the article was published had been a tough lesson about management — and herself. She was bombarded by criticism on Twitter and other social media platforms that she thought would put the company’s future in jeopardy. “It’s very upsetting if suddenly total strangers tell you that you should get an abortion,” said Ms. Korey, who is pregnant. One user on Twitter wrote: “Imagine how she’ll treat that baby.” In the moment, she said, she chose to take herself out of the chief executive role and make herself executive chairwoman. “I said, ‘I don’t know if the company needs a C.E.O. under fire right now,’” she said. “‘Why don’t we just accelerate our transition plan?’” In a separate interview, Ludwig Ensthaler, a partner at the venture capital firm Global Founders Capital and the only independent director on Away’s four-member board, confirmed that it had been Ms. Korey’s decision to step down and that there was no pressure from outside investors. He added that he should not have accepted the restructuring plan she proposed in the first place. Ms. Korey had already recruited Mr. Haselden to the company to become its president, with the promise that, after a transition period, he would be elevated to chief executive to help take the company public. When the plan changed after the Verge article was published, she said she would become executive chairwoman and Mr. Haselden the chief executive. But behind the scenes, she said, she expected both of them to operate pretty much in their original roles, just with different titles. Ms. Korey’s co-founder, Jen Rubio, will remain president and chief brand officer. “I honestly thought that people didn’t care that much about the inner workings of Away,” she said, “Who is C.E.O. and who is executive chairman — that wasn’t something that, at a private company that’s less than four years old that sells travel products, I just didn’t think would be news and people would care.” But, she said, it quickly became clear that her plan to remain at Away — effectively in the same role but with a new title — was not understood inside or outside the company. “The way it became perceived it was like I stepped down and like I left the company,” she said. “I have a very external-facing role working with new vendors, working with new partners, recruiting new candidates. And without a change, it looks like they have a board director reaching out to them who doesn’t work at the company.” Mr. Haselden said in a telephone interview that the article didn’t paint Ms. Korey as the person he knew and said her original decision to step aside “was very selfless in trying to defuse the firestorm of social media.” “But it just created a misconception that she was exiting the business, which was never the intent,” he added. Making them both co-chief executive, he said, “will clarify how we intended to operate from the beginning.” Ms. Korey said she still planned to eventually step aside after a transition period and Mr. Haselden will become the sole chief executive. Whether the article reflected an accurate picture of the company — The Verge has since published several updates, clarifications and corrections — it is hard to judge if Ms. Korey herself has changed. The company provided a trove of emails from employees that suggested they loved working for her. Yet even after the Verge article appeared, employees continued to leak screenshots of Away’s Slack channels to the site, suggesting that whatever changes had been made, some people inside the company remained unhappy. Ms. Korey said she has done a lot of soul-searching since the article was published. While she maintained that it misrepresented her behavior, she said she recognized that she had made mistakes and could improve. “When I think back on ways I’ve phrased feedback, there have been times where the word choice isn’t as thoughtful as it should have been, or the way it was framed actually wasn’t as constructive as it could have been,” she said. “Those are not, in the eyes of our leadership and the eyes of our board, terminal, unsolvable problems.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/13/business/steph-korey-away.html,business,The New York Times

The drama could escalate even more in the coming weeks as Congress moves to the next phase and preps for Trump's potential trial in the Senate.  House Democrats spent the last two months interviewing witnesses and preparing their case against Trump. The House Intelligence Committee is now writing a report that will detail the allegations that might make their way into formal articles of impeachment. Another committee has scheduled a public hearing for Wednesday to delve into the constitutional issues at play. ""This is a much more dynamic situation"" than the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, said CNN legal analyst Elie Honig. House lawmakers are running their own inquiry into Trump, instead of taking up recommendations from an independent counsel like they did in 1998. It's a safe bet that House Democrats will vote to impeach Trump, which would trigger a public trial next year in the Senate. Witnesses could be called back to testify, and new players might get involved, too. This is a rarely-ventured corner of American democracy, and there will be new twists and turns while senators deliberate whether they should remove Trump from office.  Ahead of these pivotal steps, here's a look at five surprising moments from the House impeachment inquiry that captivated Washington and could shape what comes next.  Pivotal call at a Kiev restaurant  During the first public hearing, US diplomat Bill Taylor made an unexpected announcement: He had recently learned that his aide overheard a phone call where Trump talked about Ukraine possibly announcing investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden. Not only that, but the presidential phone call unfolded in public, at a crowded restaurant in Kiev. The revelation kicked off a frenzy. Reporters scrambled to figure out the identity of the aide. Democrats hastily scheduled a closed-door deposition. The aide, David Holmes, eventually told his story to the public at an impeachment hearing last week, explaining that he overheard parts of a July call between Trump and US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland. Under oath, Holmes told lawmakers, ""Ambassador Sondland replied, yes, he was in Ukraine and went on to state that (Ukrainian) President Zelensky, quote 'loves your ass.' I then heard President Trump ask, so he's going to do the investigation? Ambassador Sondland replied that he's going to do it, adding that President Zelensky will do anything you ask him to do."" After the call ended, Sondland told Holmes that Trump ""did not give a s--t about Ukraine"" and only cared about the ""big stuff,"" like the Biden investigation, according to Holmes' account.  The riveting testimony further tied Trump to the effort to squeeze Zelensky and hurt Biden's campaign. It was a startling twist, because few had ever heard of Holmes when the inquiry began. By the end of the public hearings, his face was plastered all over national television.   Real-time witness intimidation? Trump scored an own-goal during one of the hearings thanks to his own tweeting. On the witness stand was Marie Yovanovitch, the career diplomat who US ambassador to Ukraine until her ouster earlier this year. Trump recalled her from the post amid a months-long shadow campaign against her, filled with lies, mounted by some of Trump's closest allies.  Yovanovitch was there to tell the story of her ouster, which is an important part of the Ukraine scandal but had always been a secondary plot point to Trump's potentially impeachable dealings with Zelensky. But things went off the rails after Trump got involved with a tweet, attacking Yovanovitch and blaming her for problems in the countries where she served.  ""Well, it's very intimidating,"" Yovanovitch said, during the hearing, about the Trump tweet. ""I can't speak to what the President is trying to do, but I think the effect is to be intimidating."" The text of the tweet could hardly justify a criminal charge for witness tampering, but Democrats pounced nonetheless. Some top Democrats suggested they might include Trump's attacks against Yovanovitch in an article of impeachment for obstructing Congressional proceedings.  Trump ally implicated nearly 'everyone'  A lot can change between a closed-door deposition and a nationally televised hearing. That was true for Sondland, the neophyte diplomat who donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration. Sondland was initially viewed by many as a Trump-friendly witness who might stick to the party line, even though he did defy State Department orders and show up for a deposition.  But things started unraveling pretty quickly, and Sondland was forced to revise his testimony with a sworn statement  saying that he told a Ukrainian official they likely wouldn't get the frozen US military assistance until Zelensky announced the ""investigations,"" a reference to the Biden probe. Then, when it was time to testify in public, Sondland really turned up the heat. He confirmed, in explicit terms, that there indeed was a ""quid pro quo"" in the works, where a White House invitation was withheld until Zelensky announced the investigations into Trump's political rivals.   ""Everyone was in the loop,"" Sondland said repeatedly, describing how he discussed the scheme with Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. All three top officials have disputed parts of Sondland's sworn testimony.  These top officials all ignored subpoenas, so it's unlikely they'll ever be forced to give these denials under oath. But Sondland's testimony put them in the hot seat more than ever before.  Ukraine knew early about aid freeze One of the lesser-watched impeachment hearings brought a bombshell of its own.  Senior Pentagon official Laura Cooper was sworn in after Sondland's gripping appearance on Capitol Hill, which dominated the day. But Cooper provided new information that Ukrainian officials asked her staff about the stalled military aid as early as July.  The revelation blew a hole in the GOP defense that Ukraine couldn't have been pressured by Trump because they only learned from news reports in late August about the frozen assistance.  It wasn't entirely clear from Cooper's testimony just how much the Ukrainians knew. But Cooper said her staff got emails from a Ukrainian official on the day of Trump's call with Zelensky, and they wanted to know, ""what is going on with Ukrainian security assistance?"" she recalled. The Pentagon has refused to turn over documents to House committees, so impeachment investigators and the public may not see the underlying materials anytime soon.  Budget officials quit amid frustration  The last person to give a private deposition, budget official Mark Sandy, gave lawmakers a bundle of new information. But strangely, he hasn't been called to testify at an open hearing.   Sandy, a senior career official at the Office of Management and Budget, described how one of Trump's political appointees took responsibility for the Ukraine portfolio once he started raising concerns. Until that point, Sandy had signed the paperwork officially imposing the delays.  Not only that, but Sandy also testified that he was part of a group of career officials who sent a memo recommending that the freeze be lifted because it was hurting US national security. This helps Democrats make their case that Trump undermined US interests for personal benefit.  He also testified that two OMB officials quit amid the turmoil over the Ukraine funding, which included unaddressed concerns that the holdup could have been illegal. Sandy couldn't say for sure that the two officials resigned solely because of the Ukraine affair, but he said both officials were frustrated by the situation and that they made their disagreements known before quitting.  The officials were not named in the transcript of Sandy's deposition. A senior Trump administration official disputed his testimony and said nobody quit because of the aid holdup. This story has been updated with additional developments Friday. ",https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/29/politics/impeachment-hearing-surprises/index.html,politics,CNN
121,2018-09-20 00:00:00,2018,9.0,20,Elizabeth Landers,Susan Collins' Maine office among those deluged with Kavanaugh calls,"Bangor, Maine (CNN)As the nomination process of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court has reached a crescendo in the last week, some senators are feeling the heat over what their vote will be more than others.  Maine's senior senator, Republican Susan Collins, has yet to announce her decision on Kavanaugh's nomination, and as one of the chamber's more moderate members she is a crucial vote to watch. Republicans can confirm President Donald Trump's nominee without any support from Democrats but since the GOP only controls the chamber by 51-49, there is barely any room for Republicans to lose votes from their own ranks.   And constituents from Maine and beyond are voicing their concerns, as CNN observed from her Bangor office on Thursday. ""So don't rush the vote is what you're saying?"" asked one of the staffer who worked the phones Thursday during a call with constituents.  The two aides who take calls who sit in the cozy office estimated that they receive more than a hundred calls a day on the issue of Kavanaugh's nomination.   Carol H. Woodcock, who oversees the Bangor office, told CNN that they have also received threatening calls to their office -- more than she's ever seen around any issue -- and that she keeps track of them and refers them to the Collins' DC office. Woodcock noted that the volume of calls regarding Kavanaugh and the Supreme Court are overwhelming calls on other issues like health care or veterans concerns. She is worried that other topics are getting drowned out. Though CNN was not privy to the receiving end of the phone conversation, one of the women working the phone assured a caller at one point, ""She (Collins) still does care what her constituents have to say."" The tone and attitude of the callers varies -- one call that CNN observed indicated support for Kavanaugh's confirmation to the court. Another theme in the calls: people crying. One of the staffers says she has spoken on the phone many times with women who are crying and calling to share their stories of sexual assault. Kavanaugh has been accused of sexual assaulting Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers in the 1980s. Kavanaugh has denied the allegations. Notes from the call are taken by hand -- including where the caller is from and their name -- and are then logged into a constituent services software by the office. It's not just Collins' phone lines that are being swamped. Earlier this month, Collins also faced a crowdfunding campaign from liberal activists who threaten to support her opponent in a future Senate re-election if she votes yes for Kavanaugh.  Collins also told The Wall Street Journal in an editorial published last week that the attacks, which include phone calls, from protestors have been profane. ""In one case -- and we are going to turn this over to the police, but unfortunately, of course, the person didn't leave a name or number -- but they actually threatened to rape one of my young female staffers,"" she told the paper.

122,2018-12-14 00:00:00,2018,12.0,14,"By Emma Seslowsky, CNN",Al Hunt: Trump 'certainly the worst president' in his lifetime ," (CNN)Longtime political journalist and columnist Al Hunt says Donald Trump is ""certainly the worst president in my lifetime.""  ""He's the worst president, not because I disagree with his policies -- though I disagree with many -- but I think there is a carelessness, a recklessness, meanness and, I think, corruption,"" Hunt told David Axelrod on The Axe Files, a podcast from The University of Chicago Institute of Politics and CNN.  Hunt, who got his start in Washington covering the US Treasury for the Wall Street Journal, sat down with Axelrod ahead of leaving Bloomberg, where he's been a reporter and columnist for 13 years.  Hunt's 50-year career in journalism informs his analysis of how Trump's presidency deviates from past administrations. Here is how Trump compares with some of his Republican predecessors, according to Al Hunt: Ronald Reagan Reagan ""knew what he wanted. He had a sense of what his priorities were. He had some good people around him, and that was terribly important,"" Hunt says.  One of Hunt's criticisms of Trump is the company he keeps.  He said he thinks Trump is ""someone who doesn't know any history, doesn't care about history, and he doesn't surround himself with very good people."" Hunt identified Barack Obama and Reagan as the ""two most consequential presidents"" since World War II. Reagan, in particular, was ""more flexible than his critics thought,"" Hunt said.  ""He was not the right-wing ideologue he was sometimes portrayed,"" he said. ""He was rhetorically, but not as a governmental practitioner.""  Richard Nixon ""Nixon had some respect for institutions. He had some respect for the rule of law,"" Hunt said. ""Sometimes, he said, 'You know, screw it. I'm going to disobey.' Trump has no respect for institutions. He has no respect for the rule of law."" Another area where the two presidents differ, according to Hunt, is knowing when it's ""time to go."" Hunt covered the Nixon administration, including the Watergate scandal.  ""I was there the night the committee in Judiciary voted the first bill of impeachment,"" he said, ""which is one of the most extraordinary nights in my life.""  Hunt remembers then-Republican Sen. Barry Goldwater encouraging Nixon to step down from the presidency. Nixon resigned, but Hunt doesn't believe Trump would do the same.  ""Trump won't go quietly into the night,"" he said. ""And I think that if we come to that point ... that's scary.""  ",https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/14/politics/hunt-axe-files/index.html,politics,CNN
123,2019-07-30 00:00:00,2019,7.0,30,Tami Luhby,Health care explained: Medicare for All vs public option vs the ACA," (CNN)Health care has emerged as a key fault line for Democrats. All of them want to make changes, but their plans vary widely -- from building on the Affordable Care Act to completely overhauling our nation's health insurance system. Many Americans say they are satisfied with their health care coverage, but it's pretty pricey. And the US is the only wealthy developed nation not to guarantee health care to all. Roughly one in 10 Americans is uninsured, but many more struggle to pay their medical bills. Here's a guide to what the debate is all about: Medicare for All: This proposal, spearheaded by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, would radically change the way Americans are covered, shifting control to the federal government and essentially eliminating the private insurance industry. Under Sanders' plan, Americans would be enrolled in a national health insurance program, also known as a ""single-payer"" system, which many other developed countries have. The federal government would run the program, and it -- and taxpayers -- would pay the bills. Medically necessary services would be covered and there would be no premiums, deductibles or co-pays. It would expand the current Medicare benefit package to include vision, dental, hearing and long-term care at home or in the community. Nursing home and other institutional services would be covered under Medicaid. Private insurers aren't banned, but they can't sell policies that cover benefits provided by the federal plan. That leaves them with a very niche market -- covering elective services, such as cosmetic surgery.   Public option: More moderate candidates are pushing for a so-called public option, which is a government-backed insurance plan. While a public option can take several forms, several contenders would add such a plan to the Affordable Care Act exchanges. Theoretically, the public option should be more affordable for consumers because the government could use its heft to negotiate lower rates with doctors and hospitals and to reduce costs. How effective it would be depends on how it's set up, and most candidates haven't delved into the nitty gritty details. Some seeking the nomination see a public option as an initial step towards a Medicare for All-type overhaul. But others say the best way to extend coverage to more Americans is to offer a public plan and also increase federal subsidies for Affordable Care Act policies.   Affordable Care Act: This is Obamacare, and it affects all Americans' health care today. Passed in 2010, the landmark law made sweeping changes to the nation's health care system. Some of its more notable provisions included creating the individual insurance market exchanges and expanding Medicaid to more lower-income Americans, both of which began in 2014. Some 11.4 million people signed up for 2019 policies on the exchanges, and 12.7 million folks are covered by Medicaid expansion. The law allowed children to stay on their parents' policies until the age of 26. And it barred insurers from denying coverage or charging higher rates to consumers based pre-existing protections. Insurers must also provide comprehensive benefits, including prescription drugs, maternity and mental health.   Employer-sponsored insurance: Roughly half of Americans -- or more than 150 million people -- get their health insurance through their jobs today. Three-quarters of the public have favorable views of work-based coverage, according to a new poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Of those with such plans, 86% rate their coverage as either ""excellent"" or ""good."" But these policies have become much more expensive in recent years. Annual premiums for a family plan cost almost $20,000, on average, last year, with workers contributing about $5,550 and employers paying the rest, according to another Kaiser survey. Since 2008, average family premiums have increased 55%, twice as fast as workers' earnings and three times as fast as inflation, according to Kaiser. Deductibles have also risen swiftly, contributing to the financial pinch many Americans feel when they need medical care. The average deductible for an individual is now nearly $1,575 for those workers who have one, up from $735 in 2008, Kaiser found.   Medicare: Created in 1965, this federal program provides health insurance for roughly 60 million elderly and disabled Americans. It covers hospitalization, rehabilitation and doctors' visits, but not vision, hearing, dental and long-term care. Medicare enrollees pay premiums, have deductibles and typically pay 20% of many medical services. There is also no out-of-pocket spending limit for hospitalization or outpatient services, unlike Affordable Care Act and employer plans. About three in 10 enrollees buy supplemental Medigap plans from insurers to help defray the cost of care, while roughly the same number are covered by retiree health plans from their employers. Starting in 2006, Medicare began offering prescription drug coverage -- known as Part D -- through private insurers that contract with the government. About one-third of Medicare participants are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans offered by private insurers. Some have to pay premiums, and most, if not all, have to share the cost of medical care. These policies are required to limit enrollees' out-of-pocket spending to $6,700 and may provide supplemental benefits, such as vision and dental. However, not all doctors and hospitals accept Medicare Advantage plans, while most do accept traditional Medicare.  Some candidates also favor a so-called Medicare buy-in plan, which would allow those younger than 65 to purchase Medicare or Medicare Advantage policies.

124,2018-12-05 00:00:00,2018,12.0,5,"By Tamara Qiblawi, CNN ",Yemen peace talks: government and Houthi rebels holding discussions in Sweden," (CNN)Officials from Yemen's internationally-recognized government are set to hold direct talks with Houthi rebels in Sweden on Thursday in the most significant step to end the country's conflict in more than two years. The UN-sponsored talks come amid growing international pressure for a ceasefire as the humanitarian crisis worsens in the country after more than three years of war. As many as 14 million Yemenis are suffering severe food shortages, aid agencies say, while an estimated 85,000 children under the age of 5 may have already died of starvation, according to Save the Children. The Yemeni Houthi delegation arrived in Sweden late Tuesday for the talks, along with the UN's special envoy to Yemen, Martin Griffiths, whose diplomacy has helped bring the warring parties together. Earlier, Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallström confirmed that Kuwait mediators had arrived. Kuwait hosted the last direct peace talks in 2016, which failed after Houthi rebels rejected a UN proposal aimed at ending the war. Yemeni government officials left the discussions shortly afterward.   A delegation from Yemen's Saudi-backed government was due to arrive in Sweden on Wednesday, according to the Minister of Information Moammar al-Eryani. ""The delegation is carrying the hopes of the Yemeni people to achieve sustainable peace based on the three references,"" Abdullah Alalimi, the head of the presidential office and delegation member posted on Twitter.  Griffiths' office announced on Twitter that the talks would begin Thursday. Asked about the anticipated duration of the discussions, Griffiths spokesman Hanan Elbadawi said: ""We are planning for one week."" Both warring parties -- the Iranian-backed Houthis and the Yemeni forces supported by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates -- have made overtures to one another ahead of the talks.  Yemeni Foreign Minister Khalid al-Yamani said in a statement Tuesday that the two sides have reached an agreement on a prisoner swap. He added that the Sweden talks would tackle the implementation of the exchange.  This week, the Saudi and Emirati-led coalition temporarily eased its blockade on the country to allow a plane carrying 50 wounded rebels to fly to Oman's capital for medical treatment. In November, Houthi leader Mohammed Ali al-Houthi called on rebel forces to cease missile and drone strikes against coalition positions at the request of the United Nations.  The discussions in Sweden would almost meet a 30-day deadline set by US Defense Secretary James Mattis in October for face-to-face talks.  ""Thirty days from now we want to see everybody around a peace table based on a ceasefire, based on a pullback from the border and then based on ceasing dropping of bombs that will permit the special envoy ... to get them together in Sweden and end this war,"" Mattis said October 30 at the US Institute of Peace in Washington. His call was later echoed by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who issued a statement saying, ""The United States calls on all parties to support UN Special Envoy Martin Griffiths in finding a peaceful solution to the conflict in Yemen."" But last month, the United States ""slammed the brakes on"" a UN Security Council resolution calling for a limited ceasefire and increased humanitarian aid in Yemen over concerns about angering Saudi Arabia, two sources told CNN. The draft resolution, crafted by the UK, called for a ceasefire only in Hodeidah, the principal Red Sea port through which some 80% of humanitarian aid flows. Western leaders have been increasingly critical of the Saudi-led coalition's role in Yemen's war amid the global fallout over the October 2 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Calls among Western countries for a ceasefire in Yemen have grown. Germany suspended lucrative arms deals with the kingdom last month, and Denmark and Finland have since followed suit. The Yemen conflict began after Houthi rebels took over Sanaa in August 2014 and escalated after a Saudi and Emirati-led intervention in March 2015.  The war has claimed more than 10,000 lives and sparked, what the United Nations has called, ""the world's worst humanitarian crisis."" The country is also home to the world's worst famine in 100 years, according to the United Nations.

125,2019-06-30 00:00:00,2019,6.0,30,By Michael Bociurkiw,"At the G20, those who yelled the loudest were heard (Opinion)","Michael Bociurkiw is a global affairs analyst and a former spokesman for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his; view more opinions on CNN.  (CNN)The G20 is supposed to be the time and place for multilateral consensus. Instead, it's become more of a display of the tantrum diplomacy leaders have embraced -- whoever screams the loudest or bullies the hardest is permitted to get their way.     Once again, major discord among the world's superpowers -- this time sparked by America's refusal to endorse the Paris climate accords -- calls into question whether such multilateral meetings are becoming an anachronism.   Whether they meet in Japan, Argentina or Papua New Guinea, the drift of Russia, China, Saudi Arabia -- and yes, the United States -- outside the familiar sandbox of the rules-based international order makes the summit less of a venue for compromise and unity.   That, in turn, has translated into host nations having to settle for watered-down final communiques with little accountability -- and even less substance.     United States: Left in the cold   On Saturday, the United States was left in the cold when it was the only G20 member to oppose support of the Paris agreement -- ironically as the city which lends its name to the agreement buckled under record-high temperatures.   Under a compromise, the US secured an exemption in an ""agree to disagree"" framework. The Trump administration, which reportedly failed to get Brazil, Australia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey to join it in opposition to the agreement, said the accord would cost too many US jobs. ""I'm not looking to put our companies out of business,"" President Donald Trump said.   The US going it alone at the G20 brought back memories of the Buenos Aires summit in 2018 where it insisted on a paragraph in the final statement acknowledging that it had rejected the Paris deal.     China: Protecting its interests   Superpower China, not to be outdone in Osaka as a dissident, struck out at rich countries for engaging in protectionism that was ""destroying the global trade order."" This theme is a continuation of China's resistance to any language critical of its alleged behavior to tilt the playing field in favor of its home-grown or state-owned companies.   At the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting last November, open disagreements with China prevented, for the first time ever, publication of a final communique because of Beijing's objection over wording about unfair trade practices. Instead an informal summary of pledges by participants was issued by then-Papua New Guinea Prime Minister Peter O'Neill. In the run-up to the conclusion of that summit, Chinese diplomats reportedly stormed the foreign minister's office in order to secure wording acceptable to Beijing. (China denies the incident ever happened.)     Saudi Arabia: What a difference a year makes   When historians look back at the Osaka summit, they will surely note the astonishing rehabilitation of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who, according to the CIA, masterminded the brutal murder and dismemberment of Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi. (Saudi Arabia denies the Crown Prince had any knowledge of the killing of the journalist).   What a difference a year makes: in Buenos Aires, shortly after Khashoggi's murder, bin Salman was largely sidelined and relegated in the traditional G20 final photo to the back row. Back then, the only time he seemed to have flashed a smile was when Russian President Vladimir Putin offered a high five.   This year, bin Salman was not only embraced by Trump but also placed front and center in the traditional G20 family photo, possibly because Saudi Arabia will be hosting the next G20 summit in 2020.   Be that as it may, the G20 family, presumably stewards of civility, could have demonstrated its disgust over the murder -- especially after the Crown Prince was named by a United Nations report this month as the probable orchestrator of this heinous crime -- by withholding the honor of prime placement. They could have even gone a step further by suspending the selection of Saudi Arabia as the venue for the next G20 until bin Salman is cleared. Not to do so condones such atrocious behavior and makes a mockery of the rules-based international order supposedly upheld by the G20.   There is precedent for holding powerful leaders accountable. When Russia invaded and forcibly annexed Crimea in 2014, the then-G8 switched the venue for the leaders of the group of industrialized nations from Sochi to Brussels.     Russia: Putin steps into the limelight   Trump also had a hand in applying a makeover to Putin. While Russia still remains outside G7 membership because of its Crimea annexation, if current trends continue, it won't be long before Putin will be returning to that exclusive club as well. It was only a year ago that Trump called for Russia to be re-admitted into what used to be the G8.   In Osaka, only outgoing British Prime Minister Theresa May gave Putin the diplomatic equivalent of being taken out to the wood shed, by pressing him to bring to justice the suspects in the Salisbury poisoning attack and calling for the release of 24 Ukrainian seamen in Russian custody.   Neither President Xi Jinping nor Putin, bin Salman or Trump, seem to have much regard for the G20 -- a forum which represents two-thirds of the world's population and 85% of global GDP -- or for global accords for that matter.   But it is too early to declare the ascendancy of tantrum diplomacy over multilateralism. If Trump, arguably the most petulant bull in the China shop, leaves office in 2020, the pendulum may swing the other way and his replacement can quickly undo many of his abhorrent actions which have divided the civilized world and the G20.   Perhaps it's time to recognize these ostentatious international summits for what they have become: another platform for the world's belligerent leaders to brandish their strongman agendas.

126,2018-08-24 00:00:00,2018,8.0,24,Stephen Collinson,"John McCain discontinuing treatment for brain cancer, family says","Washington (CNN)Sen. John McCain has decided to stop treatment for the brain cancer he has been battling for over a year, his family said Friday in an announcement that precipitated a rare moment of bipartisan empathy in honor of the Vietnam war hero and Republican political veteran. Colleagues of McCain, 81, had been bracing for the worst for months as the Arizona senator retreated from public life to fight the disease. But Friday's news left them shaken nonetheless. It effectively closes a tumultuous Washington career that included two unsuccessful presidential runs and saw McCain emerge as a singular political figure, an icon of the Senate and latterly as a vehement critic of President Donald Trump. ""Last summer, Senator John McCain shared with Americans the news our family already knew: he had been diagnosed with an aggressive glioblastoma, and the prognosis was serious. In the year since, John has surpassed expectations for his survival. But the progress of disease and the inexorable advance of age render their verdict. With his usual strength of will, he has now chosen to discontinue medical treatment,"" the McCain family said in a statement. The statement went on to say: ""Our family is immensely grateful for the support and kindness of all his caregivers over the last year, and for the continuing outpouring of concern and affection from John's many friends and associates, and the many thousands of people who are keeping him in their prayers. God bless and thank you all."" Cindy McCain, the senator's wife, wrote in a tweet, ""I love my husband with all of my heart. God bless everyone who has cared for my husband along this journey."" The senator's daughter, Meghan McCain, said in a tweet, ""My family is deeply appreciative of all the love and generosity you have shown us during this past year. Thank you for all your continued support and prayers. We could not have made it this far without you - you've given us strength to carry on."" Congressional leaders immediately offered sympathy. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called the news ""very sad,"" while House Speaker Paul Ryan tweeted, ""The whole House is keeping John and his family in our prayers during this time."" Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer tweeted his ""thoughts and prayers are with Senator McCain and his family.""  Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who's one of McCain's closest friends, said on Twitter that Cindy McCain ""remains steadfast and is traveling every step of the way on this difficult journey,"" and the ""love provided by Meghan and the McCain children to their father has been comforting to witness.""  Sarah Palin, the former Alaska governor who McCain controversially chose as his vice presidential running mate in the 2008 election, offered a heartfelt tribute to a man who made her a major player in GOP politics for a period at the end of the last decade. ""Prayers for @SenJohnMcCain and his family at this most trying time,"" Palin wrote in a tweet. ""May my friend sense appreciation for his inspiration to serve something greater than self."" McCain has not been in Washington since December, leaving a vacuum in the corridors of the Senate and the television news studios he roamed for decades. In recent weeks, he was not completely quiet, however. In May, he called on his fellow senators to oppose Trump's nominee to lead the CIA, Gina Haspel, citing her role in the Bush-era CIA interrogation program. His opposition to Haspel's nomination was overshadowed by leaks from the White House that then-Trump aide Kelly Sadler had responded by saying at a meeting, reportedly as a joke, that ""he's dying anyway."" McCain also frequently and directly criticized the commander in chief himself. In July, he excoriated Trump for his cozy summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, blasting the encounter as ""one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory."" ""The damage inflicted by President Trump's naiveté, egotism, false equivalence, and sympathy for autocrats is difficult to calculate. But it is clear that the summit in Helsinki was a tragic mistake,"" he said in a statement. In his final months in the Senate, McCain styled himself almost as the conscience of Congress, demanding his colleagues stand up and act as a check on the Trump presidency. In what looks like his final legislative triumph, Trump signed into law the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act earlier this month. But in a fresh sign of hostility, Trump, who once said he didn't consider McCain a war hero because he was captured, didn't even mention the Arizona senator's name. McCain has spent the last few months accepting visits and phone calls from political friends at home in Arizona. In his new memoir, ""The Restless Wave,"" he said he had received calls since his diagnosis from old sparring partners, including the two men who ended his White House dreams in 2000 and 2008: former presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. In the book, written in deepening recognition of his own mortality and at a polarized political moment, McCain wrote: ""Before I leave, I'd like to see our politics begin to return to the purposes and practices that distinguish our history from the history of other nations. ""I would like to see us recover our sense that we are more alike than different."" Speaking to CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" last September, shortly after he went public with his prognosis, McCain said he was ""very happy"" with his life and what he has ""been able to do."" ""I am able to celebrate a wonderful life and I will be grateful for additional time that I have,"" the senator said at the time.

127,2019-04-25 00:00:00,2019,4.0,25,Doug Criss,A legislative compromise could spur California to pass the strictest police deadly-force bill in the country," (CNN)Activists in California, still angry after no police officers were charged in Stephon Clark's fatal shooting, want to raise the legal threshold for when officers can use deadly force. Meanwhile, the state's police unions and groups affiliated with law enforcement pretty much want things to remain the same. To that end, they're asking the state to codify existing best practices for when deadly force can be used by officers. Each side has a bill espousing its point of view that's working its way through the state Assembly. But in a surprise legislative maneuver aimed at reaching a compromise, the fate of the bills have been linked together, which would raise California's deadly-force standard to perhaps the highest in the nation. Seeking a new standard The bill favored by the activists, Assembly Bill 392, would ""authorize officers to use deadly force only when it is necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily injury or death,"" the bill's sponsor, state Assemblywoman Shirley Weber, said back in February when she introduced it.  Using deadly force against a fleeing suspect would only be justifiable in the officer's self-defense or the defense of another person if the officer believes the suspect will harm someone else unless stopped. Weber's legislation would also require officers to attempt to defuse a situation before using lethal force. Family and friends of Clark -- a 22-year-old black man who was shot and killed in his grandmother's backyard by Sacramento police in 2018 -- and the ACLU have also publicly spoken in favor of the bill. The fate of the two bills is joined But law enforcement-affiliated groups oppose Weber's bill and instead back Senate Bill 230, which would codify into law the existing use-of-force rules while also stressing de-escalation and focusing on additional training for police. That bill is sponsored by state Sen. Anna Caballero. The fate of the two pieces of legislation became linked together when Caballero pulled the ""use of force"" wording from her bill because it would have set a different legal standard for it than Weber's bill.  So if law enforcement supporters of Cabellero's bill want the rest of her legislation to succeed, they'll have to accept passage of Weber's bill. ""My bill is linked with hers,"" Caballero told the Sacramento Bee. ""If her bill doesn't get through, it all disappears. I don't think any of us want this to disappear."" Both bills are still in committee and have not yet come up for votes in the full state Assembly or state Senate. CNN has reached out to Weber and Caballero and is waiting to hear back.

128,2019-03-01 00:00:00,2019,3.0,1,Nicole Gaouette,"Abrupt end to Trump-Kim summit prompts sighs of relief, questions about what's next"," (CNN)The news that President Donald Trump walked away from negotiations with North Korea early and empty-handed led many experts and lawmakers to heave sighs of relief, even as the summit's abrupt finale raises questions about where things go from here.  Many had worried that the President, eager to score a success and distract from damaging testimony by his former personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen, would make a deal that endangered America's national security and possibly decrease the chances of Pyonyang denuclearization. According to people familiar with conversations among the President's senior national security officials, Trump told some advisers ahead of the Hanoi talks that he did not want to appear overly thirsty to secure a deal, hoping to prove wrong the myriad analysts who predicted he'd give away the store to demonstrate some type of progress. Trump insisted at a press conference that he and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un were executing a ""nice walk"" away from the table -- but what exactly happened in Vietnam isn't at all clear, as both sides emerged with different stories in the hours after they packed up and headed home. Trump was unpleasantly surprised by a demand from Kim that all sanctions be lifted on North Korea, according to a person familiar with the negotiations, believing the young despot had come to Hanoi prepared to deal.  But North Korean Foreign Minister Ru Yong Ho offered a contradictory story. ""What we proposed was not the removal of all sanctions, but their partial removal,"" the North Korean official said, pointing to United Nations sanctions from 2016 and 2017 that ""impede the civilian economy and the livelihood of our people."" In Washington, the anti-climactic end prompted a flood of relief. 'No deal is better than a bad deal' ""No deal is better than a bad deal,"" said Duyeon Kim, a Korea expert at Center for a New American Security. ""Lifting key economic sanctions without proportionate denuclearization steps risk losing leverage."" And even though the odds of success were low, with a mere month for the US team to prepare, many Republicans portrayed the draw as a victory.    ""It's better to walk away than sign a bad deal,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and fierce critic of the Kim regime. ""What he did in Hanoi was the right thing to do -- he walked away from a bad deal,"" former Republican Sen. Rick Santorum told CNN's ""New Day,"" adding that this was ""a wonderful moment in (Trump's) presidency.""  Robert Galluci, a former US negotiator with North Korea, said he thought ""the outcome was, potentially, perfect ... because things I worried about didn't happen and things I wanted to happen, did happen."" ""I worried that we would make concessions that were not good,"" Galluci elaborated in a call arranged by the Stimson Center. He worried Trump would go along with a Chinese and Russian proposal ""that we give up joint exercises with the ROK in exchange for the North Koreans giving up further testing of ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons."" There had been some concern that the US would sign off on a formal end to hostilities with North Korea and, as a result, Trump would agree to pull US troops from the Korean Peninsula.  The President had claimed that the removal of US troops from South Korea was not on the table, but there were still fears that Trump would change his mind at the last minute. During his post-summit press conference he bemoaned -- and exaggerated -- the cost of maintaining a US military presence.  Instead, Washington and Pyongyang are now at ""a pause,"" Galluci said. ""There will be continuing efforts to go beyond the place we are at. And this is a fine temporary position we're at."" Trump had been advised by senior members of his national security team -- including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton -- that he should walk away from the talks if they proved unfruitful, according to an official familiar with the summit.  He was cautioned in the days and even hours leading up to the talks that North Korean negotiators were unprepared to budge on their demands on sanctions during pre-summit talks led by Stephen Biegun, the administration's special envoy. Kim as unbending as advertised Trump still believed he could make something happen in Hanoi, the official said, and was disappointed to learn Kim was just as unbending as advertised. Despite the warnings, Trump still felt there was a chance Kim would prove reasonable at the negotiating table -- perhaps one reason why the White House listed a signing ceremony on the public version of President's schedule the evening before. One official later described that as a mistake, since it wasn't at all clear the two sides would agree to anything during the talks. Pompeo told reporters after the summit that there had been progress at the working level, even though the US walked away from the summit empty-handed. He explained that a ""lot of brush"" has been cleared over the last two to three months. The top US diplomat didn't offer examples. Pompeo said that he wished they had ""gotten a little bit further"" in nailing down steps toward the ultimate goal of denuclearization. ""It's been a steady stream of progress towards getting to where we want them to be,"" Pompeo said. ""We just didn't get far enough."" He seemed to intimate that the teams made some progress, telling reporters that, ""We all went back and tried to sharpen our pencils and see if we couldn't get a little further and we actually did."" But he cautioned there will be no quick fixes in what is likely to be a lengthy negotiation. ""It is a long ways, we have always known it was a long ways,"" Pompeo said. And at the end of the day, he acknowledged, the potential for real progress is ultimately in the leaders' hands. ""You don't know which ones you are actually going to get until the two leaders actually have a chance to get together,"" Pompeo said. ""There was a lot of preparatory work. We were prepared for the potentiality of this outcome as well. And tomorrow we will get right back at it."" Missed opportunity for North Korea On the North Korean side, the abrupt and disappointing end to the Hanoi summit is likely not a deal breaker when it comes to diplomacy with Washington, but is certainly a major setback, said CNN International correspondent Will Ripley, who has visited the country 19 times and interviewed top officials.  ""Trump-Kim 2.0 was supposed to help both countries build trust, gain respect and deepen mutual understanding,"" Ripley said. ""The fact that North Korean foreign ministry officials felt compelled to hold a rare press conference in the middle of the night in Hanoi shows how strongly they felt their position was grossly misrepresented at the podium by Trump."" Both sides dispute how much the other asked for in the closed-door talks, but Ripley said that while the North Koreans may have been prepared for a vigorous back-and-forth negotiation, ""they undoubtedly were shocked by President Trump's decision to walk out of the talks and cancel a working lunch.""  ""Based on what we know about the North Koreans and their negotiating style, they always come to the table well-prepared and they always follow protocol. Above all else, they value the dignity of their Supreme Leader. Kim's delegation must have been mortified by what could be perceived as a humiliating loss of face,"" he added.  ""Not only did the US President walk out of the talks, he also snubbed the final meal they were supposed to share together. The table was set and menu prepared for what should've been a friendly working lunch ahead of the scheduled joint signing ceremony. Instead the snow fish and banoffee pie turned cold and the table sat empty -- a symbol of the wasted opportunity in Hanoi."" Another get together 'before too long' Pompeo said that he believes working level negotiators will get together ""before too long,"" but added that both sides need to regroup and that there would need to be a reason to meet.  ""Look, there has to be a reason for the conversations. There has to be a theory of the case about how to move forward. I'm confident that there is one,"" Pompeo said.  Joel Witt, director of the Stimson Center website 38 North, which monitors North Korea, said  ""I'm not sure where it goes from here."" One possibility, Witt said, is that ""this essentially represents another hinge point, historic hinge point, in our efforts to stop North Korea's nuclear program, where there may have been a missed opportunity."" Or it could be analogous to the 1986 summit between then President Ronald Reagan and Soviet Union's leader Mikhail Gorbachev, which eventually led to groundbreaking nuclear arms control treaties. ""I guess we have to watch and see what are the next steps, in terms of re-engaging, maybe at the working level, to try to make some more forward progress."" In the meantime, Pompeo acknowledged that the nuclear treat North Korea poses is still very real. ""The reason we are having these conversations is because we are concerned about the threat to the world,"" Pompeo told reporters. ""That is the reason we are after this.""

129,2019-04-11 00:00:00,2019,4.0,11,Zachary B. Wolf,Tax refunds: Red states doing better than blue states," (CNN)Most American taxpayers got tax cuts last year, thanks to the new tax law. They just may not have realized it. And filing their returns Monday won't help make it clearer: Refunds have barely risen this year.  Final data from the IRS won't be available for some time, but the tax preparer H&R Block reports that on average, its clients' tax liability -- how much federal tax they paid -- is down by a lot, almost 25%. But the average refund -- how much they get back from the government after filing their annual returns -- is up just 1.4%. Barely at all. (That's just for people who got refunds in both the 2017 and 2018 tax years. It does not include the people who went from getting a refund last year to paying the IRS this year.)  And there's a political divide: Red states will enjoy the biggest increase in refunds. However, several blue states are seeing the largest average tax cuts compared with last year. H&R Block processes around 20 million returns each year and its figures here are for returns filed through the end of March.  These numbers will change, since many people who will owe money may not have filed yet. People who expect refunds tend to file earlier, according to Nathan Rigney, lead tax research analyst at the Tax Institute at H&R Block.  $6 billion less in refunds Less detailed filing season data from the IRS through March 29 shows the government has paid 2.2% fewer refunds so far and the average refund of $2,873 is $20 smaller than it was in 2018. And the IRS has paid $6 billion less in tax refunds this year, almost 3% less than last year. There's a lot of psychology associated with how Americans pay their taxes, which means people could be seriously disappointed in the massive 2017 tax cut law, which brought them a temporary cut, gave corporations a much larger permanent tax rate reduction and is expected to make the US government's budget deficits spiral in excess of $1 trillion each year starting in 2022. Most people don't think they're paying less That frustration has been evident on social media from people who are surprised that the new tax law didn't get them bigger checks at filing season. ""It's that expectation, and this is sort of human behavior about loss aversion: We're a lot more likely to feel the pain of a loss than enjoy that small gain, and that's what we're seeing,"" said Rigney. The anecdotal frustration is borne out in polls, which suggest most Americans don't realize they got a tax cut. In an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll out this week, just 17% of respondents think they are paying less in taxes under the new law, compared with 28% who think they are paying more. Others don't know or said their taxes haven't changed.  How did this happen? Just before the law passed, Trump used the promise of immediate benefits to help sell it to Congress. On Dec. 13, 2017, he said: ""If Congress sends me a bill before Christmas, the IRS -- this is just out, this is breaking news -- has confirmed that Americans will see lower taxes and bigger paychecks beginning in February"" (it was actually March).  And the IRS did change the tables that govern how much is withheld in taxes from people's paychecks throughout the year. While that process -- the subject of a Government Accountability Office investigation -- was shown to be opaque, it did result in Americans getting a paycheck bump in March of 2018. But many may not have noticed, since the tax cut was spread out over the year instead of handed out as a lump sum. And now taxpayers aren't seeing much of a bump in their refunds. They'd need to change their withholding if they want to get bigger refunds, said Rigney, who pointed out that even more money will remain in their paychecks in 2019, since the new tables will be in effect for a full year instead of nine months or so.  IRS officials and financial planners might argue smaller refunds are a good thing since people are keeping more of their money. But many people rely on their refunds as a sort of forced savings plan. It could even have a ripple effect on the economy: Retail spending is down compared with recent years and smaller tax refunds could be to blame.  A surprise for high-income filers in high-tax states Not everything is as expected in the H&R Block data, according to Rigney. In some states with high state taxes, there had been worry that new rules limiting the amount of state and local taxes (SALT) that could be deducted would lead to massively higher tax bills for some. Those fears have now been offset because many fewer people are paying the alternative minimum tax. ""They come out better under the new law,"" said Rigney. ""They get significant rate decreases. They're also not paying AMT and so they're actually allowed to deduct up to $10,000 SALT deduction they didn't get any benefit from in the past."" This generally benefited much higher-income families with many deductions, often between $250,000 and $1 million, he said. But that shouldn't be a surprise. The tax law generally is much more generous to higher-income filers and families. Red states vs. blue states While some states that supported Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016 were among those with the largest average drop in tax liability, the 10 states with the largest increase in refunds were all red. The 10 states with the largest decrease in refunds are all blue.  New Jersey actually had the largest average tax cut among H&R Block filers in the company's data through March, despite its high state tax rate and the potential effect of a cap on state and local tax deductions. Filers in Massachusetts, California and Connecticut also saw big cuts. Refunds in those four blue states, however, also shrank. Pre-filing projections suggested that 65% of filers would be getting tax cuts as a result of the new law, according to the Tax Policy Center. But the wealth is not spread evenly, according to the projections. Most Americans in the very lowest income brackets won't see any bump at all, while 90% of top earners will see tax cuts. Americans in California and East Coast blue states like Maryland, New York and New Jersey are more likely to see tax increases. It will be interesting to see how that bears out in the IRS' final data for this season. A note on the data from H&R block: ""H&R Block analyzed federal tax returns for prior H&R Block clients completed through March 31, 2019 in its offices and online, which shows how refunds and tax liability have changed for individuals rather than overall. The H&R Block analysis also limited the dataset to returns that had the same factors in each year. For example, to look at tax reform's impact on homeowners, the data set included only those clients with mortgage interest in both years, to avoid skewing results.

130,2019-07-17 00:00:00,2019,7.0,17,"By Erica Orden, CNN",Feds end investigation into Trump Org and hush money payments,"New York (CNN)Federal prosecutors in New York have ended their investigation into the Trump Organization's role in hush money payments made to women who alleged affairs with President Donald Trump and have been ordered by a judge to release additional information connected to their related probe of former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, according to court documents filed Wednesday. CNN reported Friday that the Manhattan US Attorney's office had approached the end of its investigation of the Trump Organization and wasn't poised to charge any executives involved in the company's effort to reimburse Cohen for money he paid to silence one of the women. That payment constituted an illegal campaign contribution, according to prosecutors. Trump has denied the affair allegations. ""The campaign finance violations discussed in the Materials are a matter of national importance,"" US District Court Judge William Pauley wrote in his decision. ""Now that the Government's investigation into those violations has concluded, it is time that every American has an opportunity to scrutinize the Materials."" Pauley ordered a copy of the government's July status report and copies of search warrant materials from the Cohen case to be filed publicly with very limited redactions by Thursday at 11 a.m. ET.  The conclusion of federal prosecutors' investigation of the Trump company's role in the Cohen matter marks a significant victory for the President's family business, although it likely doesn't come as a complete surprise. There had been no contact between the Manhattan US Attorney's office and officials at the Trump Organization in more than five months, CNN reported Friday. An attorney for the company declined to comment. A lawyer for Trump, Jay Sekulow, said: ""We are pleased that the investigation surrounding these ridiculous campaign finance allegations is now closed. We have maintained from the outset that the President never engaged in any campaign finance violation."" In April 2018, the FBI executed searches of Cohen's home, hotel room, safe deposit box, cell phones and email accounts. Portions of the search warrant material were made public earlier this year after the judge ordered them revealed in response to a request by media companies. But the judge allowed prosecutors to redact significant parts of the material because they related to the government's ""ongoing investigation.""  RELATED: Michael Cohen's life behind bars The Trump Organization investigation was launched out of the Cohen case, in which he pleaded guilty to eight counts, including two counts of campaign-finance violations for orchestrating or making payments during the 2016 election to two women -- adult-film actress Stormy Daniels and ex-Playboy model Karen McDougal -- who alleged affairs with Trump. Cohen is now serving a three-year prison sentence.  After Cohen made the $130,000 payment to Daniels, he was reimbursed, prosecutors said in court filings, by the Trump Organization. The company's executives authorized payments to him totaling $420,000, in an effort to cover his original payment, tax liabilities and reward him with a bonus, according to prosecutors, and they falsely recorded those payments as legal expenses in their books.  The criminal inquiry centered on whether those payments, like the hush money Cohen gave to Daniels, violated campaign-finance law.  The judge on Wednesday said he would allow the government to keep the redaction of an uncharged third party when it files its status report and would permit the search warrant materials to be filed with redactions of the names of law-enforcement investigators and people who did business with Cohen in connection to taxi medallions he owned.

132,2018-05-03 00:00:00,2018,5.0,3,Sandra Gonzalez,Tanya Saracho's road to 'Vida'," (CNN)It's Thursday morning at the Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills, and Tanya Saracho is demonstrating the proper way to eat a taco.  Her hands are in the air, hovering in front of her bright red lips, as if holding a deliciously messy corn envelope. She tilts her head sideways and pretends to bite.  ""You don't bring the taco to you, you meet it,"" she says, repeating the motion a few times for good measure. ""And you turn to it."" In the script for the first episode of her upcoming Starz drama ""Vida,"" the first-time showrunner made sure to make note of the maneuver in a scene when one character, back in town to bury her mother, makes a therapeutic visit to her favorite local taqueria. A line in the script reads: ""She eats a taco the right way.""  Not everyone will notice the detail, Saracho says, ""but you'll notice.""  I did.  But Saracho was not making an assumption because my last name ends in a ""z."" She knows I know the right way to eat a taco because we both grew up in a place where taquerias are only outnumbered by people named Juan.  Saracho and her family moved to the Rio Grande Valley from Mexico when she was about to start middle school. If the entire southern border of the state was the shape your foot makes when its in a high heeled shoe, the Valley, as it's called in short, would be the ball of the foot.  When Saracho was coming of age in the border region, it was different than it is now. Much more ""porous,"" she says.  These days, the relationship between the countries whose cultures meet in the perpetually warm slither of Texas where we once called home is complicated to say the least. But what remains true about the region, Saracho says, is that it breeds a certain confidence of culture -- something that served her then and certainly serves her now. When the area you grow up in is predominantly Hispanic -- more than 85 percent, according to Census data -- there is an absence of the ""otherism"" that can prove so toxic to a young person, says Saracho. ""It prepared me in so many ways for this hybridity, but I didn't know it was preparing me,"" she says. That's not to say her transition to an American school was always easy. There were fashion missteps (""I was dressing like a weird immigrant...a lot of blue jean."") and language learning curves that would make reading aloud in class an lesson in the cruel quirks of the English language (why is Plymouth not pronounced ply-mouTH?).  The accent that left her embarrassed and headed home in tears some days, however, also led her to compete in speech and debate in school, paving the way for a segue into high school drama.  The speech and debate part of the equation had actually been an accident. She signed up thinking she'd be receiving speech therapy -- to help her shed her accent -- but proved to excel because she had a natural talent for voices and natural inclination for animated delivery. (Years later, she'd pay the bills while rising the ranks as a Chicago playwright by becoming the Spanish-speaking voice of Special K cereal for ten years.)  It wasn't until fate and some stubborn determination landed her in at Boston University and later Chicago, where she'd establish a theater company, that she realized the rest of the country doesn't quite operate like the Valley. One story stands out in particular. The night she moved into her Roscoe Village two-flat in Chicago, two white, female neighbors gave Saracho and her roommate some lemonade and launched into an explanation about the neighborhood while sitting on the stoop of their new building. Watch out for the ""sketchy areas,"" they said.  ""'Over there you have some...""  Saracho lowers her voice to a whisper recalling their tone. True to her speech competition roots, she tells all her stories like she's acting out a play and doing every part. ""...black people.'""  They did it again when saying the word ""Mexicans.""  She'd never heard anyone do that before -- say ""Mexican"" and ""black"" like they were bad words.  She kindly informed them that she, in fact, was Mexican. The girl felt the need to clarify and said she was talking about ""the other kind of Mexican.""  ""And so I think I spent the rest of my time in Chicago, those 15 years, unpacking what she meant,"" Saracho says.  Not throwing away her shot ""Vida,"" which premieres Sunday, centers on two sisters (Melissa Barrera and Mishel Prada) who upon returning home to the east Los Angeles neighborhood where they grew up after the death of their mother discover they have quite a bit of unpacking to do themselves -- as daughters who discover their dead mom was secretly married to a woman and as people who have a complicated relationship with their culture and neighborhood.  It's not an autobiographical show, but Saracho and her all-Latinx (a gender-neutral term for people of Latin descent) writers infused it with terminology, images, and themes rarely seen on TV.  One term was the word pocha, a derogatory made-up word that in essence refers to a person trapped between Mexican and American cultures, as if to say you can't do either right.   Saracho says it is being reclaimed by a new generation as a positive. There is no ""right"" way to be anything.  ""[The main characters] are not the children of immigrants,"" she said. ""They're the grandchildren of immigrants, and that's important too, because that's American. That's being American.""  At Starz, Saracho, who's worked on shows like ""How to Get Away with Murder"" and ""Devious Maids,"" recently inked a three year overall deal, which means she'll develop new projects for the network. Or, as Saracho explains it to her mother, a loving and faith-driven woman who has never been Los Angeles and doesn't quite understand what her daughter does for a living: ""They gave me a job for three more years.""  With ""Vida,"" her first show for Starz, she became the first Latina showrunner in the premium cable space, according to the network's senior vice president of original programming, Martha Fernandez. When the network put out a call for work from and meetings with Latinx creatives in Hollywood in late 2015, Saracho's play, ""Mala Hierba,"" caught the network's attention.  By early 2016, Saracho was in Fernandez's office, going into detail about how her love for the network's show ""Outlander"" sent her to Scotland and, by chance, into the path of a handsome Scot she sees whenever one of them can make the long journey. (""I was supposed to stay two weeks and I stayed six."")  True story. ""Even the way she was telling me the story was incredible -- all the little flourishes, all the funny moments, all the suspense she put in there,"" Fernandez remembers. ""I was like, 'Alright, I have to work with this lady.'"" It helped, too, later on, that Saracho delivered a knock-out pitch for a show the network had been looking for someone to develop -- a Latino-centric story about gentrification and gender identity, with a  L.A. backdrop.  That pitch became ""Vida.""  ""It was real; it was authentic. You can tell this wasn't somebody on the outside looking in and making assumptions about what it means to be Latina, what it means to be queer, what it means to be the other,"" Fernandez said. ""This is somebody who with a lot of heart and humor really had an insider's perspective.""  That's not exactly how the people of Boyle Heights felt about Saracho when ""Vida"" was announced. To them, she was no different than the the gentrifying villain her show features -- a vendida (sell-out),  a gente-fier, a ""white-tina"". (Saracho had never heard the term before, but after having it yelled at her while filming, she worked it into the script.)   This didn't sit well with Saracho. So, she listened.  After getting a six-episode order from Starz based on their pilot presentation -- the 15 minute teaser for Starz executives used to lobby for a greenlight -- she vowed to disrupt the Boyle Heights ecosystem as little as possible. They found other parts of East L.A. to stand in for corners they'd be shooting in often. On the rare day they had to film in Boyle Heights, they made sure their big trucks and base camp were out of the way, often at a large cemetery or field house that was not in use.  ""I was listening to them, to respect and to be there the least amount that we could,"" she says. ""Because they're right. When you go...you kind of gentrify the neighborhood a little bit. And if you're in production three months, you're a gentrifying force. I get it.""  She admits, ""I don't know if a non-Mexican show runner would have thought about that necessarily.""  This is a case, I say, for the argument that networks should be hiring people of color to tell their own stories.  She nods. ""Because then you're careful with the community whose story you are telling."" ""Vida"" is ripe with communities that TV has historically forgotten, particularly the queer Latinx population.  If ""Transparent"" and ""Orange is the New Black"" marked important moments for visibility, ""Vida"" is the next chapter of that progress.  ""It's like pick-up basketball but it's art and it's feminist art and it's female gaze-creating,"" ""Transparent"" creator Jill Soloway, a friend of Saracho's who worked with her on HBO's ""Looking,"" tells me later. ""So when I watch 'Vida,' it's like, this is a conversation between all of us.""  She adds: ""I feel like we're all creating this legacy together.""  '...eventually they will hear you' It's the night of the ""Vida"" premiere in downtown Los Angeles when I see Saracho next.  She's thrilled because she told Starz they should have a pink carpet instead of a red carpet at their premiere, and they delivered.  She knows it's a small detail, but it's huge, she says, because it proves she has a voice in this craziness.  If only the people at the status symbol hotel on a hill who wouldn't park her Ford Focus years ago could see her now. Maybe she'd even be seated without being harassed first. She's trying to take it all in, because she knows there are so many people like her who deserve to have a moment like this, but don't and won't.  ""My hope is [this] says we're ready for these sorts of stories and these sorts of narratives,"" she says. ""I hope it's not just a trend.""  She hopes to see ""the Dominican 'Vida'"" one day or ""the Puerto Rican 'Vida.'"" She hopes ""Vida"" makes room for more complicated narratives about what it means to be American. She hopes Hollywood takes chances on Latinx showrunners that don't have a lot of experience (""because until you get the shot, you don't know if you can do it""). She hopes more of the voiceless get heard.  ""To that little kid who was 13 and trying to figure out her accent, I'd [say], 'Keep speaking out because eventually they will hear you.'""  And that fight to be heard is just part of vida. ",https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/03/entertainment/vida-starz-tanya-saracho/index.html,entertainment,CNN
133,2019-05-19 00:00:00,2019,5.0,19,Marshall Cohen,10 things to know about the revelations that Trump's lawyers tried to influence Flynn ,"Washington (CNN)Michael Flynn's dealings with Robert Mueller erupted back into the headlines this week, after court documents disclosed he had told the special counsel about communications he had with people around Donald Trump related to his cooperation. The revelations add some nuance around Flynn's time as a cooperator and raise several new questions about Mueller's obstruction probe. Here are 9 questions to get up to speed: What happened? People ""connected to the administration or Congress"" left a voicemail for Flynn or his lawyer that ""could have affected"" his cooperation with Mueller, court records revealed on Thursday. Flynn gave Mueller a recording of that voicemail as part of his assistance to the Mueller probe. The Mueller report mentions a voicemail that fits that description. The report says a call to ""Flynn's counsel"" was made in November 2017 -- days before Flynn formally pleaded guilty -- and it came from ""the President's personal counsel,"" without naming names. In the call, Trump's attorney obliquely referenced Flynn's cooperation, asked for a ""heads up"" if he would implicate Trump, and said he should remember Trump's positive feelings toward him. ""If... there's information that implicates the President, then we've got a national security issue...we need some kinds of heads up,"" Trump's lawyer told Flynn's lawyer, according to the Mueller report. ""Just for the sake of protecting all our interests if we can... remember what we've always said about the 'President and his feelings toward Flynn and, that still remains.'"" Who made the call? The Washington Post reported on Thursday that this call was made by John Dowd, who was one of Trump's personal attorneys. Dowd could not be reached by CNN for comment.   Jay Sekulow, Trump's only other personal attorney handling the Russia investigation at that time, told CNN that he did not leave the voicemail referenced in the Mueller report. Other lawyers around Trump, like then-White House special counsel Don McGahn and White House counsel Ty Cobb, worked for the administration and would not have been labeled as Trump's ""personal counsel"" in the report. Is this obstruction of justice? Mueller's team didn't say whether this phone call amounted to criminal obstruction of justice committed by the President. But Mueller clearly considered that the phone call may have been an obstructive act, writing in his final report, ""That sequence of events could have had the potential to affect Flynn's decision to cooperate, as well as the extent of that cooperation."" Mueller didn't offer a judgment in his report or in the court filings about how Dowd approached Flynn. There is no indication from the Mueller report that Trump's attorneys were even investigated for crimes. Any speculation that Trump's lawyers broke the law with this phone call appears to be a bit ahead of the facts. If Mueller believed he could investigate Trump's attorney, and if he believed that the call did cross the legal threshold for obstruction, Mueller or another prosecutor could have brought charges. The investigation is over, and nobody was charged with crimes related to this voicemail.  Why didn't Mueller get to the bottom of it?   It's not entirely clear why Mueller didn't analyze Dowd's decision to make the phone call. Was it that Mueller only wanted to look at the President's actions -- and not others' -- around this particular event? Did Mueller want to avoid a court tangle with Dowd? A footnote suggests Mueller determined any interaction Trump may have had with Dowd about Flynn as confidential and protected by law. ""Because of attorney-client privilege issues, we did not seek to interview the President's personal counsel about the extent to which he discussed his statements to Flynn's attorneys with the President,"" the Mueller report says. (It's important to note that if Mueller wanted to pursue more investigation into the call as a possible crime, he may have been able to breach the confidentiality. Attorney-client discussions can't stay sacred if a client is asking an attorney to commit a crime.)  Mueller ends his analysis of the voicemail inconclusively, saying he couldn't determine if the President directed Dowd to make the call. ""Because of privilege issues, however, we could not determine whether the President was personally involved in or knew about the specific message his counsel delivered to Flynn's counsel."" Did Mueller care about obstruction? Mueller, a former FBI director, homicide prosecutor, US Attorney and Department of Justice top brass, cared a great deal about investigating obstruction of justice. The special counsel ultimately produced 182 pages that looked at 10 situations where Trump may have obstructed justice. Mueller found, in several of these instances, that Trump could have obstructed the investigation and had reason to want to -- meaning Mueller detailed evidence to support obstruction charges. But Mueller refused to decide whether Trump should be charged, leaving that decision to Attorney General William Barr. Mueller also wasn't afraid of going after liars whose false statements could have muddled the investigation. In all, he secured six guilty pleas that involved lying to authorities -- from Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, to Michael Cohen, George Papadopoulos and Alex Van Der Zwaan, and including Flynn, too. Two other defendants in the Mueller probe have been charged with obstruction, and both of their cases are still unresolved. Those defendants are: Roger Stone for allegedly lying and threatening a witness and the Russian Konstantin Kilimnik allegedly reaching out to possible witnesses who could have testified against his business associate and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. What else do we know about outreach to Flynn? There was more communication with Flynn than the one voicemail described in the Mueller report.  Court filings indicate that there were ""multiple instances"" of contacts between Team Trump and Flynn's camp, and Flynn provided investigators with information about these incidents. The Mueller report highlighted a few examples. Before Flynn flipped and started to cooperate, Trump asked some of his closest aides to convey messages of support to Flynn. This included his son-in-law and senior White House adviser Jared Kushner, then-White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, Flynn's onetime deputy KT McFarland, and spokeswoman Hope Hicks. The court filings also said someone ""connected to... Congress"" was in touch with Flynn about his cooperation. Based on the language in the memo from Mueller's team, it appears that this could be a Hill staffer or political donor and may not be a member of Congress. The person hasn't been identified yet, though that could potentially be revealed in future disclosures.  Why is this coming out now? The voicemail Trump's lawyer left for Flynn's lawyer was highlighted in the version of the Mueller report made public on April 18. The report was so rich in detail and covered so many investigative threads that parts of it didn't receive much initial scrutiny. For example: How Flynn's attorney became a witness in the Mueller investigation, to discuss the voicemail with Mueller.  But scrutiny of Flynn is far from over. He has not yet been sentenced for his crime of lying to investigators, and federal Judge Emmet Sullivan has demanded transparency in his case. The Washington Post had sued to make public some information that prosecutors put under seal in the Flynn case, and Sullivan agreed. That led to the Justice Department's public disclosures on Thursday of previously redacted descriptions of his cooperation, and of FBI memoranda about their interactions with Flynn in early 2017. What has Trump said about the situation? Trump weighed in on the situation with a tweet Friday morning, saying: ""It now seems the General Flynn was under investigation long before was common knowledge. It would have been impossible for me to know this but, if that was the case, and with me being one of two people who would become president, why was I not told so that I could make a change?""  The President didn't mention the questionable backchanneling between his lawyer and Flynn's lawyer. But his tweet was misleading on other fronts and lacked some relevant context.  It's generally against Justice Department policy to publicly reveal ongoing cases, so it's no surprise that the investigation was underway before it was ""common knowledge."" Flynn personally informed senior members of the Trump transition team in January 2017 about the investigation, and so did his attorneys. But it's not clear when exactly Trump was briefed. While Trump wasn't told by the Justice Department about the Flynn probe before taking office, he received at least two prominent warnings against hiring Flynn as national security adviser. President Barack Obama told him not to give Flynn a White House job during their post-election meeting. So did New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican and one of Trump's close allies during the 2016 campaign. Senior Justice Department officials eventually warned the Trump White House about Flynn's conduct, primarily that he lied to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador. The administration waited two weeks after getting that information before Trump forced Flynn to resign. Will we learn more, and when?  It appears several more revealing documents about Flynn may be public by June. Sullivan ordered that the Justice Department disclose in Flynn's court case the transcript of the voicemail and transcripts of Flynn's conversations with Russian officials. Mueller quoted the voicemail in his report, though he used many ellipses to clip sentences.  And the full text of Flynn's calls with then-Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the Trump transition has never been revealed -- and may still be classified. Mueller has only paraphrased the exchanges in those calls in his report. And on top of all this, Sullivan has asked for the Justice Department to make public the parts of the Mueller report related to Flynn that are still redacted. The deadline is May 31.

134,2018-07-17 00:00:00,2018,7.0,17,Veronica Stracqualursi,Trump says Putin meeting went better than NATO summit,"Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump defiantly defended on Tuesday his meeting with Vladimir Putin, saying his encounter with the Russian leader went ""even better"" than his summit with NATO leaders last week. Trump's tweet comes amid an uproar over his decision to not endorse the US intelligence community's assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election over Putin's denial, and his scolding of US allies last week for what he said was inadequate financial contributions to NATO. ""While I had a great meeting with NATO, raising vast amounts of money, I had an even better meeting with Vladimir Putin of Russia. Sadly, it is not being reported that way - the Fake News is going Crazy!"" Much of the reporting following the summit focused on the widespread and bipartisan backlash he faced, including from several powerful Republicans on Capitol Hill. The tweet came shortly after Trump claimed that increased NATO spending was ""only because of me."" ""NATO was weak, but now it is strong again (bad for Russia). The media only says I was rude to leaders, never mentions the money!"" Trump tweeted. While NATO members pledged in 2014 to raise their defense spending to two percent of GDP by 2024, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said Trump deserves credit for giving a new sense of urgency to the increases, saying that NATO's European members and Canada have added an additional $41 billion in defense spending since Trump took office. However, while Stoltenberg gives Trump part of the credit, many NATO members began increasing their defense spending prior to his taking office as the security concerns including Russia's military incursions into Ukraine and its annexation of Crimea as well as the rise of ISIS are also seen as contributing to the defense boost. Trump's tweets on Tuesday come after he has faced withering criticism at home and abroad for his international trip in which he met NATO leaders, British Prime Minister Theresa May and Putin at a summit in Helsinki, Finland. In Belgium, Trump levied harsh accusations against member states of the longtime US alliance, at one point accusing Germany of being held ""captive"" by Russia. He further inflamed US relations among NATO allies by meeting with Putin, who has been isolated by much of the West following his annexation of Crimea in 2014, and created a firestorm back in the US when he said he didn't ""see any reason why"" Russia would attack US elections. Instead, Trump touted Putin's vigorous denial and pivoted to complaining about the Democratic National Committee's server and missing emails from Hillary Clinton's personal account.

135,2018-04-09 00:00:00,2018,4.0,9,Chris Cillizza,Michael Cohen raid: Here's what he still hasn't told us about the Stormy Daniels payment," (CNN)The FBI raided the law office of Donald Trump personal attorney Michael Cohen on Monday, seizing records that are related to several topics, including payments to porn actress Stormy Daniels. Whoa. ""The decision by the US Attorney's Office in New York to conduct their investigation using search warrants is completely inappropriate and unnecessary,"" Cohen lawyer Stephen Ryan said. ""It resulted in the unnecessary seizure of protected attorney client communications between a lawyer and his clients."" Trump reacted angrily to the news, calling Cohen a ""good man"" and describing special counsel Robert Mueller's probe as a ""total witch hunt."" Remember that last week, for the first time, Trump addressed the $130,000 payment 11 days before the 2016 election from Cohen to Stormy Daniels, who alleged she had a 2006 affair with Trump.  Trump denied knowing anything about the payment and, under further questioning from reporters, said this: ""Well, you'll have to ask Michael Cohen. Michael is my attorney. And you'll have to ask Michael Cohen."" So, in that vein, here are five questions that Cohen needs to answer. 1. Why did you pay Daniels $130,000 if you believed Trump hadn't engaged in an affair with her? Cohen has been adamant that he didn't think there was any ""there"" there in terms of Daniels' allegations, but has said he made the payout ""defensively"" on behalf of his client. So why didn't Cohen make similar payments to the dozen (or more) other women making allegations about Trump's conduct with them over the years? Or did he? 2. Why did you use your personal money to pay off Daniels? Cohen took out a home equity line of credit to make the payment to Daniels. He insisted he did so with absolutely no promise or expectation of repayment from Trump or anyone related to the President or his company. Which is, um, odd. Why would Cohen put himself in financial trouble -- or at least stretch himself financially -- to make a six-figure payment to a porn star whose claim of an affair was totally baseless? 3. Why did Cohen set up an LLC in Delaware to make the payment? Cohen established Essential Consultants LLC in Delaware -- a state widely known for its lack of corporate transparency -- 10 days before he made the payment to Daniels. Why? The obvious answer is to make the payoff as untraceable as possible. But if Cohen believed there was nothing to Daniels' allegations, why go out of your way to hide the payout? 4. Why did Cohen file for a restraining order against Daniels? The genesis of Daniels' lawsuit that Trump broke the rules of their ""hush"" agreement  is this attempt by Cohen to silence her (again). Why was Cohen so set on keeping Daniels from telling her story about her alleged relationship with Trump? He went WAY out of his way to keep her quiet -- and in so doing provoked the lawsuit that brought us ""David Dennison"" and ""Peggy Peterson"" among other things.  5. Why was Trump Inc. employee Jill Martin involved in that lawsuit being filed? Cohen said for months that he was acting alone -- with no knowledge or involvement from Trumpworld. Why then was Martin, a high-ranking legal official in Trump's corporation, the one who filed the arbitration document against Daniels in a California court? Cohen says it was solely because Martin happened to be available to help out. So, there were NO other attorneys in California that Cohen could have asked to file that legal motion? In order to believe everything that Cohen has said, you need to believe this: Trump's longtime personal fixer took out a home equity line of credit to make a $130,000 payment to a porn star alleging an affair with Trump. Cohen created an LLC in a state legendary for its lack of corporate disclosure to make the payment, despite the fact that he didn't believe Daniels' story. He went to considerable lengths to keep Daniels from breaking the hush agreement, including filing suit against her in court -- and using a senior member of Trump Organization's legal team to do so. Which is possible, I suppose. But it requires a whole lot of assumptions and take-my-word-for-its. And Cohen hasn't offered much beyond perfunctory statements in response to repeated revelations about the payoff to Daniels. What we know: A series of search warrants were executed against Cohen on Monday. While Mueller reportedly referred the matter to the FBI, it is not believed to have anything to do with his ongoing probe into Russia's attempted meddling in the 2016 presidential election. That seems to make the Daniels' payment the most likely focus -- although it may well not be the only focus. ",https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/09/politics/michael-cohen-raid/index.html,politics,CNN
136,2018-03-13 00:00:00,2018,3.0,13,Sandra Gonzalez,"Hulu scores TV series from Reese Witherspoon, Kerry Washington after 'bidding war'"," (CNN)Reese Witherspoon is on fire.  The actress continued her streak as one of TV's hottest producers with a new series for Hulu based on the book ""Little Fires Everywhere"" by Celeste Ng.  Kerry Washington and her production company Simpson Street are set to executive produce the show with Witherspoon's Hello Sunshine production company. ABC Signature Studios will also produce. ""Little Fires Everywhere"" is being billed as a limited series by Hulu, which scored the project after a ""bidding war"" that ""ignited Hollywood,"" according to a victory lap press release from the company.  Witherspoon and Washington are set to star in the series that follows the intertwined fates of one picture-perfect family and an enigmatic mother and daughter who suddenly come into their lives.  ""The story explores the weight of secrets, the nature of art and identity, the ferocious pull of motherhood -- and the danger in believing that following the rules can avert disaster,"" Hulu said.  The project is just the latest TV effort to be added to Witherspoon and Hello Sunshine's increasingly full plate. In addition to producing the second season of Emmy-winning ""Big Little Lies,"" the company has three series in the works at Apple.  One of the projects is a drama starring Jennifer Aniston and Witherspoon about the culture of morning shows and another is a comedy starring Kristen Wiig. They're also developing a series toplined by Octavia Spencer called ""Are You Sleeping."" ""Little Fires Everywhere"" scored a straight-to-series order from Hulu, meaning the concept did not go through a pilot stage.

137,2019-07-25 00:00:00,2019,7.0,25,Devan Cole,Ilhan Omar on Donald Trump: America's 'basic promise is under threat. Our democratic institutions have been weaponized',"Washington (CNN)Rep. Ilhan Omar, who has been engaged in a highly-personal feud with President Donald Trump, said in a new op-ed that the 2020 presidential election will be ""a fight for the soul of our nation,"" arguing that Trump has ""weaponized"" the country's democratic institutions.  ""The president's rally will be a defining moment in American history. It reminds us of the grave stakes of the coming presidential election: that this fight is not merely about policy ideas; it is a fight for the soul of our nation,"" Omar wrote in the opinion piece published Thursday in The New York Times.  Omar, who along with three other minority congresswomen known as ""the squad"" was recently criticized by the President in racist terms, was referring to chants of ""send her back"" that broke out last week at a rally hosted by Trump in North Carolina. The chants, which were eventually disavowed by the President, echoed similar language he used in his recent attacks on the congresswomen. ""Today, that basic promise is under threat. Our democratic institutions have been weaponized,"" Omar, a Minnesota Democrat, wrote in the op-ed. ""And the president has used overtly racist rhetoric to strike fear and division in communities of color and religious minorities across the country."" She continued: ""The idea -- explicitly expressed by this president and enshrined into law by executive order -- that people from certain Muslim-majority countries cannot enter this country is not just bad policy; it is a direct threat to liberal democracy.""  Omar also argued in the op-ed that by making his attacks on the four lawmakers, Trump was distracting Americans from his administration's policies.  ""Throughout our history, racist language has been used to turn American against American in order to benefit the wealthy elite. Every time Mr. Trump attacks refugees is a time that could be spent discussing the president's unwillingness to raise the federal minimum wage for up to 33 million Americans,"" she wrote. ""Every racist attack on four members of Congress is a moment he doesn't have to address why his choice for labor secretary has spent his career defending Wall Street banks and Walmart at the expense of workers."" Last week, the House voted to condemn the racist language Trump used in his attacks on the lawmakers. Since then, he has continued his attacks on the group, questioning earlier this week their commitment to America and saying on Twitter that they are ""destroying the Democrat Party.""

138,2018-10-25 00:00:00,2018,10.0,25,Kara Scannell,Bomb suspect manhunt: FBI treating case as domestic terrorism," (CNN)Law enforcement officials from New York to Florida are examining clues to find the person or persons who sent 10 packages containing what appear to be explosive materials to prominent Democrats, critics of President Donald Trump, and to CNN's New York offices as authorities classify the incidents as domestic terrorism.  Authorities believe several of the packages went through the Opa-locka, Florida, processing and distribution center, according to two law enforcement officials familiar with the investigation.  The devices mark one of the most serious attempts to stoke fear and terror in the US in a period that has already seen a number of violent political attacks. The apparent bombs, while rudimentary in design, according to law enforcement officials, targeted two former US presidents, a former vice president and potential presidential contender, and numerous outspoken critics of the Trump administration. Three new packages were detected Thursday -- two intended for former Vice President Joe Biden and one for actor-director Robert DeNiro -- each bearing the same markings as the seven packages detected earlier this week.  Later Thursday, parts of Time Warner Center -- the building that houses CNN's bureau in New York City -- were evacuated after two suspicious packages were found in the building. The New York Police Department's bomb squad declared the scene to be all clear just after 8:30 p.m. Two small boxes had been left unattended and the packages didn't match the description of those sent to CNN and political figures. As authorities examine clues, they are also finding more questions to answer.  One key question authorities are puzzling over is why none of the apparent bombs detonated, a second law enforcement source said, raising questions about the skill and motive of the bombmaker.  This person said either the bombmaker was good enough to ensure none would go off and never intended them to explode or it was poorly constructed. Authorities consider the bombs to be potentially destructive because of the presence of what is believed to be pyrotechnic powder. Though it appears they were handled through the postal system -- and thus jostled and moved -- without triggering any explosion.  William Sweeney, FBI special agent in charge of the New York field office, said Thursday afternoon that the powder discovered with the package sent to CNN did not pose a biological threat but another official said it was undergoing testing.  The FBI's counterterrorism team is leading the investigation and has classified it as a domestic terror matter, the law enforcement official said. That classification is based on the absence of other information and could change.  The Secret Service, US Postal Inspector Service and ATF are also working on the investigation with various state and federal offices. Officials said it is possible additional packages could have been mailed to other locations and not yet discovered.  NYPD and FBI officials stressed Thursday that the investigation was still in its early stages and they continued to seek tips from the public.      ""Everything is a clue,"" a law enforcement official said.  Fingerprints and evidence The bombs were packaged in manila envelopes with bubble-wrap lining, according to the FBI. They each bore computer-printed address labels and six American flag stamps.  All 10 packages went through the US mail system, according to multiple law enforcement officials familiar with the investigation. The package addressed to John Brennan at CNN's New York office was delivered by a private courier company who delivers the mail to CNN on a daily basis, one of the law enforcement officials said.  It is not uncommon for large companies or public figures to hire outside companies to pick up the mail at the post office, scan it off site and deliver it to the intended recipient, the official added. Previously officials had said the package delivered to George Soros was placed in his mailbox. The law enforcement source said Thursday that Soros utilizes a company to filter his mail.   Investigators will be looking for fingerprints on the package, on the back of any tape that may have been used, and on the stamps and labels. If the seals were licked, investigators may be able to pull DNA from the saliva, officials say. They will also look for any hairs or other materials that could help identify the sender or location. Investigators who traced a string of package bombs in Texas that killed two people and wounded five in March used those same tools to pull DNA from the packages.  In addition, investigators used signals from cell phone towers to help narrow down the potential suspects in the area at the time the packages were dropped off, according to a law enforcement official. They relied on closed circuit cameras to narrow the field further, the official said. It took investigators 18 days to track down Mark Anthony Conditt, who killed himself with one of his own explosive devices. Those tactics are likely to be deployed as authorities trace couriers and any individual who may hand delivered the packages. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was asked in an interview by Fox News about indications the packages came from Florida. She said the FBI is tracking down all leads, noting ""as you know some of the packages went through the mail.  They originated some of them from Florida. So that was an obvious lead to pursue.""  Bombs transported to Quantico All of the bombs are being transported to the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia, for analysis, officials say. Other information on the packages will also be rich investigative lines. If the packages were scanned by the US postal system, investigators may be able to determine which machines scanned the documents and when. However, unlike FedEx or other private mail delivery services, the US mail system is not set up to track every single piece of mail. Authorities believe several of the packages went through the Opa-locka processing and distribution center. According to a US Postal Service employee, this facility handles mail that is incoming and outgoing from south Florida. Philip Bartlett of the US Postal Inspection Service told reporters that authorities are not yet able to say where the packages were mailed from. The Miami-Dade Police says it is assisting the investigation at the Florida mail facility, the department tweeted. At the lab the bombs themselves will be dissected. According to a law enforcement official, the bombs so far appear to show the presence of a sulfur substance, which would be the ingredient that was intended to explode. Authorities will examine the components of the bomb and look for clues as to where they may have been purchased and any similarities or differences between the individual packages. Pipe bombs are inherently unstable devices and could be set off simply by handling them.  Outside experts have pointed to the lack of a triggering mechanism, suggesting it was never meant to explode. The device includes very common components, making it more difficult to get clues from the signature of the bomb. But the components could still provide clues -- like the clock and the tape used.

And he's rejecting the premise like an opponent's ill-advised layup. ""What I've noticed over the past few months,"" James shared with CNN's  Don Lemon during a sit-down interview on Monday.  ""(Is) he's kinda used sports to kinda divide us, and that's something that I can't relate to."" Referencing Colin Kaepernick, whose kneeling protests during the pre-game national anthem launched an NFL movement, and more recently, Stephen Curry, who honored his promise of skipping a visit to Donald Trump's White House, James bemoaned a myriad of instances in which Trump has twisted peaceful displays of dissent into an indictment of a decaying American value system. ""I can't sit back and say nothing,"" said James, who lists participating in youth athletics as one of the most inclusive experiences of his upbringing. ""Sports was the first time I was ever around someone white,"" revealed the four-time NBA MVP. ""I got an opportunity to see them and learn about them, and they got the opportunity to learn about me ...  And I was like, 'Oh wow, this is all because of sports.'"" Flashing the trademark smile that has routinely graced magazine covers and commercial shoots since he was a junior in high school, James laughed at learning how much earlier his youthful ""white friends"" ate dinner and went to bed, and noted his surprise at seeing food stored in a pantry. ""For me, everything where I grew up was on top of the refrigerator,"" he explained. Feeding young minds Now a 33-year-old man, with two sons and a daughter, James has more pantries, and more refrigerators, than he'd ever dreamed of as the child of a single teen mom living the ""everyday struggle"" in Akron, Ohio. But it's from this existence that his ""I Promise School"" has been born. James' foundation has teamed with the Akron (Ohio) Public Schools system to create an elementary school that will support at-risk children in his hometown.  ""We want every kid that walks through this school to be inspired, to come ... away with something, something where they can give back,"" said James, who poured millions from his own pocket into the project.  ""For kids, in general, all they want to know is that someone cares.  And when they walk through that door, I hope they know that someone cares."" Asked by Lemon about the prospect of entering politics after his playing days, James at first dodged the subject like so many defenders throughout his career. But when asked what he would say if someone told him, ""If you don't run, Trump's going to win,"" he had a change of tune.  ""Well, in that case, I may (run),"" James said. ""I believe there's someone else out there. I hope.""  Queried on what he'd say to Trump if they were face to face, he was quick to say, ""I would never sit across from him."" James' main focus is helping the next generation conquer their obstacles -- with inspiration from the past. ""If we look at some of the greatest leaders of our time, you look at, you know, Muhammad Ali, you look at Dr. Martin Luther King, and all the adversity they went through,"" he told Lemon. ""They always use it to say 'OK, this is even more motivation, this is even more a way for me to even be more powerful.'  And they're the reason why we are here today.""

140,2019-08-03 00:00:00,2019,8.0,3,"By Sheena McKenzie, Daniel Silva Fernandez and Elizabeth Wells ",Scientist who called out Bolsonaro on Amazon deforestation is fired," (CNN)Brazil has fired the head of a government agency that found a steep rise in deforestation in the Amazon, following a public spat with far-right President Jair Bolsonaro.  Ricardo Galvão, the director of Brazil's National Space and Research Institute (INPE), said he was terminated on Friday after defending satellite data that showed deforestation was 88% higher in June compared to a year ago.  Galvão said in a video statement on Facebook that the agency let him go after a meeting with Brazil's Minister of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communications, Marcos Pontes. He added that the scientific institute would continue to operate and it would now be up to Pontes to decide on his successor. An advisor to Pontes confirmed Galvão's comments to state news agency Agencia Brasil. Bolsonaro claims the data is wrong  The scientist butted heads with Bolsonaro after the damning satellite data was released earlier in June, turning the international spotlight on the President's controversial plans to open up the world's largest rainforest to industry. Bolsonaro called the INPE's findings ""lies"" and said they were harmful for trade negotiations, according to Agencia Brasil.  But Galvão stood firm, reaffirming the validity of his scientific institute, which has been monitoring the country's forests since the 1970s. He said the president had made ""inappropriate accusations [of] people of the highest level of Brazilian science,"" in an interview with newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo. CNN contacted the Brazilian government for comment but has not received a response.  Brazil's opposition leader in the lower house of Congress, Alessandro Molon, said in a tweet that Galvão ""was attacked by the president and the environment minister for monitoring deforestation in the Amazon,"" adding that Bolsonaro wanted to ""hide under his lies."" Controversial environmental policies  Bolsonaro, a former army captain, took office in January on the heels of a campaign pledging to restore the country's economy by exploring the Amazon's economic potential. Brazil is home to two-thirds of the Amazon, and during the first few months of Bolsonaro's presidency, the rate of rainforest destruction remained stable, according to the INPE. But it began to soar in May and June, the agency said. Some 769.1 square kilometers were lost in June, six months after Bolsonaro took power -- a stark increase from the 488.4 square kilometers lost in the same month the previous year, according to the INPE. It equates to an area larger than one and a half soccer fields, being destroyed every minute of every day.

Barrack told CNN that his session at the summit was canceled because he was scheduled to speak with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who pulled out of the event on Thursday. ""As a consequence, I postponed my visit,"" said Barrack, who chaired the president's inaugural committee. Barrack, a real estate investor, has known Trump for 40 years. He's previously helped raise money to support Trump's political ambitions and has publicly defended the president.

JPMorgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, BlackRock (BLK) CEO Larry Fink and Blackstone (BX) CEO Stephen Schwarzman said earlier this week that they will not attend. Mnuchin announced his decision shortly after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo briefed Trump on his visit earlier this week to Riyadh to discuss the Khashoggi case.  Pompeo urged patience with the Saudi investigation, telling reporters that he advised the President to give the Saudis ""a few more days"" — but Mnuchin followed up shortly afterward with a tweet saying he would not go to Riyadh, reversing the position he's taken over the past week. ""Just met with @realDonaldTrump and @SecPompeo and we have decided, I will not be participating in the Future Investment Initiative summit in Saudi Arabia,"" Mnuchin tweeted Thursday.

142,2018-07-22 00:00:00,2018,7.0,22,Joshua Berlinger,Pompeo accuses Iranian Supreme Leader of profiting from $95 billion hedge fund," (CNN)US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo delivered a scathing speech on Iran's leadership Sunday, accusing Tehran's ruling ayatollahs of spreading violence across the Middle East and lining their own pockets with ill-gotten gains at the expense of ordinary Iranians. ""The ideologues who forcibly came to power in 1979 and remain in power today are driven by a desire to conform all of Iranian society to the tenants of the Islamic Revolution. The regime is also committed to spreading the Revolution to other countries, by force if necessary,"" said Pompeo during a highly anticipated address at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California. Southern California is home to a significant portion of the Iranian diaspora living in the United States. Many of them fled Iran after the revolution that brought Iran's ayatollahs to power.  ""To the regime, prosperity, security, and freedom for the Iranian people are acceptable casualties in the march to fulfill the Revolution,"" said Pompeo. The secretary of state and former CIA director accused several members of Iran's leadership, including Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran, of participating in widespread corruption.  Khamenei, Pompeo alleged, maintains a personal off-the-books hedge fund worth $95 billion, that is untaxed and used as a ""slush fund"" by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Crops (IRGC). The IRGC is a branch of the country's armed with influence over practically every aspect of Iranian life. ""The level of corruption and wealth among regime leaders shows that Iran is run by something that resembles the mafia more than a government,"" Pompeo said. ""These hypocritical holy men have devised all kinds of crooked schemes to become some of the wealthiest men on Earth while their people suffer."" Pompeo's speech came just hours after Iranian President Hassan Rouhani told diplomats in Tehran that the United States ""must understand that war with Iran is the mother of all wars and peace with Iran is the mother of all peace,"" according to Iran's state-run news agency IRNA. ""Do not play with the lion's tail, because you will regret it eternally,"" Rouhani said. Shortly after Pompeo's speech, Trump tweeted that Iran will ""suffer consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before"" if it were to threaten the United States again. Though the tweet was addressed to Rouhani, it's unclear if he was responding to the Iranian President's comments earlier Sunday. Pompeo's speech was briefly interrupted by protesters shouting ""think about the children,"" likely a reference to US President Donald Trump's immigration policies that have led to children being separated by their family at the border. Once they were done, Pompeo said ""if there was only so much freedom of speech in Iran."" A handful of prominent Iranian-Americans were in the audience, including Washington Post columnist and former Tehran bureau chief Jason Rezaian.  Rezaian spent months in Iranian detention on what many believed were spurious charges of spying on behalf of the United States. Also in attendance for the speech, titled ""Supporting Iranian Voices,"" was Makan Delrahim, a US assistant attorney general in the Department of Justice's antitrust division. Delrahim came to the United States at 10 years old.  A new pressure campaign Since his time in Congress, Pompeo has been a vocal critic of the Iranian regime and the internationally negotiated deal to limit Tehran's nuclear program and subject it to international verification in exchange for sanctions relief. The Trump administration backed out of that deal in May. Among the President and Pompeo's many criticisms of the accord was that it did not do enough to limit Iran's destabilizing behavior in the region, such as funding Houthi rebels in Yemen and Hezbollah in Lebanon, a powerful political force in that country. The United States considers Hezbollah a terror group. The Trump administration is now expected to re-enact many of the punishing sanctions that were in place before the 2015 agreement was reached, including limiting Iran's ability to sell oil.  ""We are asking every nation who is sick and tired of the Islamic Republic's destructive behavior to join our pressure campaign. This especially goes for our allies in the Middle East and Europe, people who have themselves been terrorized by violent regime activity for decades,"" Pompeo said. ""The goal of our efforts is to one day see Iranians in Iran enjoying the same quality of life that Iranians in America enjoy."" Rouhani has warned that the deal could fall apart and hinted that Iran could restart its nuclear efforts if the US were to re-enact sanctions, though the European signatories of the accord have pledged to honor it.  'Wolves in sheep's clothing' Many in the international community consider Rouhani and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif as moderates within Iran, owing to their support of the nuclear deal. In his speech, Pompeo criticized the notion that Zarif and Rouhani could be considered moderate when Iran has continued to fund Shiite-backed groups engaged in violence across the region. Presidential candidates in Iran must be vetted by a clerical body, and once elected the head of government answers to the Supreme Leader. ""The regime's revolutionary goals and willingness to commit violent acts hasn't produced anyone to lead Iran that can remotely be called a statesman. Some believe that President Rouhani and Foreign Minister Zarif fit the bill. The truth is they are merely polished front men for the ayatollahs' international con artistry. Their nuclear deal didn't make them moderates, it made them wolves in sheep's clothing,"" Pompeo said.  ""These so-called moderates within the regime are still violent Islamic revolutionaries with an anti-America, anti-West agenda.""

Johnson, 89, co-founded Johnson Products Company, the pioneering black hair care company which made iconic products such as Ultra Sheen and Afro Sheen. She died Friday in Chicago after a long illness. She started Johnson Products Company in Chicago in 1954 with her husband, George Johnson. They took a $250 investment and turned it into a multi-million dollar company which became the first black-owned company to be traded on the American Stock Exchange (now known as NYSE American). ""When I think about pioneers, the real pioneers are the people who are able to make a path where none exists,"" her son Eric G. Johnson told CNN. ""Johnson Products in many ways was that company. She and my father had no provided path. They created a path where there was none."" Eric Johnson said his mother was the true matriarch of the family. Her company helped another icon ""(Joan was) someone I always admired,"" publicist Dori Wilson told CNN. Wilson had known Johnson since about 1970 and said Johnson and her husband were role models for many. ""The Johnsons were the first successful family we in the African American communities read about,"" she said. ""She was perceived as a shrewd and smart businesswoman. I can't remember any other product that was really synonymous with the African American community."" The company also helped the growth of another American icon which got its start in Chicago: ""Soul Train."" In the early 1970s Johnson Products became a sponsor of the groundbreaking TV dance and musical variety program, which went on to run in national syndication for almost four decades. She was a college trustee Johnson's family described her as an advocate for women. She was a trustee at Spelman College, the black women's college in Atlanta, according to her obituary, and her family plans to continue her legacy by supporting the school with an annual scholarship. She was also known for her sense of style and was a sponsor and organizer of the Congressional Black Caucus Fashion Show. ""She truly was a grande dame in every sense of the work,"" said Linda Johnson Rice, CEO of Johnson Publishing Company, which formerly published Ebony and Jet magazines. ""Dignified, smart, sharp-witted and fun. I have many fond memories of my conversations with her...dispensing life advice. Her life is one to be celebrated.""

144,2019-04-25 00:00:00,2019,4.0,25,Zachary B. Wolf,Analysis: Pete Buttigieg is driving the religious right nuts," (CNN)The only Democrat talking at length about his faith in the 2020 primary also happens to be the only gay candidate in the race. And he's one of the few from a red state. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg is an Episcopalian who can freely quote Bible verses. He's also a presidential candidate who embraces his husband on stage at campaign rallies. Combining homosexuality and Christianity might be the most natural thing in the world for Buttigieg and millions of gay Americans, but it is an iconoclastic development in American politics, where generalizations about religious freedom have in recent years been used specifically to fight advances in LGBTQ rights. For some on the religious right, like Franklin Graham, Buttigieg's identity, while it's shared by many gay Americans of faith, does not compute. Graham, in a series of critical tweets, said that being a gay Christian ""is something to be repentant of, not to be flaunted, praised or politicized."" Graham's position is ironic and hypocritical given his and the religious right's embrace of Donald Trump as President. No one should presume to know another person's faith, but it is a statement of fact that Trump is a thrice-married megalomaniac who is certain in his infallibility and has mangled Bible verses when he's tried to read them out loud. But conservative faith leaders have pushed Trump and applauded him in particular for his selection of conservative Supreme Court justices like Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, who they hope will challenge court precedent on abortion and marriage equality. Buttigieg has poked at this hypocrisy, questioning whether Trump believes in God. He's brought attacks on Vice President Mike Pence, who has joined the fight against gay rights and who wears his faith -- he is an evangelical Christian -- on his sleeve. ""I hope that Pete will offer more to the American people than attacks on my Christian faith or attacks on the President as he seeks the highest office in the land,"" Pence told CNN's Dana Bash after Buttigieg's criticism, later adding, ""he'd do well to reflect on the importance of respecting the freedom of religion of every American."" Comments from leaders like Graham, a supporter of Trump who is now saying Buttigieg's interpretation of faith is flawed, will complicate Pence's argument that his own faith is being targeted by Buttigieg. What drew Graham's ire were comments at a CNN town hall this week, when Buttigieg was asked by a woman who described herself as a bisexual Christian, how he will ""challenge the right's moral monopoly on Christianity to unite conservative, moderate and liberal Christians alike..."" His full answer is worth reading, but the essence is that he acknowledged it ""can be challenging to be a person of faith who's also part of the LGBTQ community"" while also saying his understanding of faith is far different than Pence's or Graham's: ""Part of where I'm coming from is a faith tradition that counsels me to be as humble as possible, that counsels me to look after those who need defending.  And frankly, it couldn't be more radically different than what I see certainly in this White House, where there's a lot of chest-thumping and self-aggrandizing, not to mention abusive behavior, but also a political agenda that seems to always be revolving around the idea that somehow it's too easy for poor people in this country. It's just so different than what I get when I read scripture.  And I get that one of the things about scripture is different people see different things in it. But at the very least, we should be able to establish that God does not have a political party."" There is still a strong religious divide in the country on the subject of gay rights. In a 2017 Pew survey, there was strong support (62%) among all Americans for same-sex marriage like the one a Supreme Court decision allows Buttigieg to enjoy. Just 32% of Americans oppose it. More than two-thirds of Americans not affiliated with a religion (85%) support it, along with Catholics (67%) and white mainline Protestants (68%). But support was less than 50% among other groups Pew broke out, including black Protestants (44% support) and white evangelical Protestants (35%). That divide carried over to political groups. Just 40% of Republicans supported same-sex marriage in the survey, compared to 73% of Democrats and 60% of Independents. There are other polls, such as this one from Pew, that document how Republicans are more likely to believe in God than Democrats, that they're more likely to go to church, and that religion plays a larger role in the lives of more Republicans than Democrats. Which is not to say that Democrats don't rely on religious voters. But they tend to focus on black churches. Trump, however, is equally or more reliant on white evangelicals to help him win re-election. Pence is not the only evangelical Christian working for the President; his press secretary Sarah Sanders said God wants Trump to be in office. It's not at all clear that Buttigieg would be able to win over more churchgoers than other candidates. Hillary Clinton, a churchgoing Methodist, spoke less often than him about her own faith, but she did talk about it. She lost in 2016, however, among people who go to church monthly or more (Clinton got 43% to Trump's 53%), according to exit polls. She won 54% - 39% among people who go less than that. The country is changing, however.  In 2016, fewer than half of voters (49%) said they went to church monthly or more. In 2012, 55% of voters in exit polls said they went to church monthly or more. In 2008, it was 54%. In 2004, it was 56%. That trend of less church attendance by voters is mirrored in a 2018 Gallup survey of Americans at large that found even fewer -- 43% -- attend church monthly or more. It was 58% when Gallup asked the question in 1992. ",https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/25/politics/religion-and-hypocrisy-are-clashing-with-sexuality-in-2020/index.html,politics,CNN

That enabled the court to look as though it was not owned by one side or another and was indeed impartial and neutral and fair,"" Kagan said.  She continued: ""It's not so clear going forward. That sort of middle position, you know, it's not so clear whether we'll have it."" Kagan's comments come as President Donald Trump looks to fill the vacancy left by Kennedy with Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who is expected to be confirmed by the Senate during a final vote Saturday.  Kavanaugh was accused in September of committing sexual and physical assault more than 30 years ago, and he testified about the alleged incident at a hearing with the Senate Judiciary Committee last week. During the hearing, some of Kavanaugh's testimony appeared blatantly political -- in one instance he called the handling of the accusation ""a calculated and orchestrated political hit.""  ""This whole two-week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit, fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election, fear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record, revenge on behalf of the Clintons and millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing opposition groups,"" Kavanaugh said. Kagan, speaking alongside fellow Supreme Court Justice Sonya Sotomayor, on Friday emphasized the importance of maintaining the court's legitimacy ""especially in this time where the rest of the political environment is so divided."" ""Part of the court's legitimacy depends on people not seeing the court in the way that people see the rest of the governing structures of this country now. In other words, people thinking of the court as not politically divided in the same way, as not an extension of politics, but instead somehow above the fray,"" she said.

146,2019-05-01 00:00:00,2019,5.0,1,"By Jamie Ehrlich, CNN",Roy Moore campaign teases 2020 run,"Washington (CNN)Roy Moore, the failed Alabama Senate candidate and former judge, teased a 2020 Senate run in a fundraising email that compares the 2017 accusations against him to the sexual assault allegations levied against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.  In an email signed by Moore's wife, Kayla, the campaign makes a plea for funds to go towards ""paying legal fees and court filings,"" and says Moore is ""seriously considering another run for the United States Senate!""  A report published by The Washington Post in November 2017 based on interviews with more than 30 people said that Moore pursued relationships with teenagers while he was in his 30s. One woman said she was 14 years old when Moore initiated sexual contact with her. The accusations, in part, contributed to Moore's loss against Sen. Doug Jones in December 2017 for the Senate seat once held by Jeff Sessions.  Leigh Corfman, who said Moore sexually abused her as a 14 year old, sued Moore for statements the campaign made following her interview with the Post. In a counter-suit filed jointly with his wife last year, Moore claimed the women who accused him of sexual assault were part of a political conspiracy. The defendants included three women who made accusations against Moore as well as two other people. The legal battle is still in the courts.  Because Jones won his seat in a special election, he will be up for reelection once again in 2020.  ""It was no strange coincidence that only 10 months later these same false and scurrilous tactics would again be used in the midst of a very important Supreme Court nomination process of Brett Kavanaugh in 2018,"" Moore's wife writes in the email.  Though Kavanaugh was accused by Christine Blasey Ford of sexual assault when the two were in high school, Kavanaugh was not formally charged. Two other women, including Ford, also accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault or misconduct. Despite a bitter confirmation hearing and tumultuous vetting process, Kavanaugh was ultimately successfully confirmed by a narrow majority to the Supreme Court. He denied the allegations.  Moore's life following his losing bid for Senate has been litigious. In July 2018, Moore sued a Democratic-aligned super PAC for defamation, claiming that campaign ads that ran during the special election race damaged his reputation. And in September of 2018, Moore filed a multimillion dollar lawsuit against comedian Sacha Baron Cohen after he fell for a prank on the actor's TV show months after his campaign ended. Though Moore dropped the defamation lawsuit against the super PAC, his lawsuit against Cohen still remains in the courts.  Before running for office, Moore was suspended twice from the Alabama Supreme Court.  ",https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/01/politics/roy-moore-2020-run-kavanaugh/index.html,politics,CNN
147,2019-02-07 00:00:00,2019,2.0,7,Matt Egan,Bitcoin is an insurance policy against 'irresponsible' government,"Grand Cayman (CNN Business)Bitcoin might be down 80% from its peak, but true believers in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology still gush about its enormous potential. Some still see bitcoin as the ultimate hedge against disaster.   ""There is a really good chance we have something better than gold,"" Travis Kling, founder and chief investment officer of crypto hedge fund Ikigai Asset Management, said on Thursday at the Cayman Alternative Investment Summit in Grand Cayman.  ""It's like a CDS against fiscal and monetary policy irresponsibility,"" Kling said. Credit default swaps, or CDS, are akin to insurance policies. These financial instruments pay out when a borrower defaults on debt. CDS grew infamous during the 2008 crisis when AIG, one of the biggest issuers of CDS, nearly collapsed itself.  Like other crypto bulls, Kling is alarmed by the build-up of debt on government balance sheets and extreme steps taken by global central banks to encourage growth. Some fear that high budget deficits and low interest rates will eventually lead to hyper-inflation and erode the value of the US dollar and other major currencies.  ""That is how you would write the script"" for the ""mass adoption"" of a new kind of currency that isn't controlled by government authorities, he said.  Despite the collapse of bitcoin prices, Morgan Creek Capital Management is launching a crypto fund that will complete its fundraising on Friday.  The fund will focus in part on crypto infrastructure, the ""picks and shovels"" of the space, Morgan Creek founder and CEO Mark Yusko said.  ""We believe bitcoin will be one of, if not the, largest network on the planet,"" Yusko said. ""We are in the middle of the greatest wealth opportunity ... It's beyond any of our imaginations."" Morgan Creek is investing in a company that seeks to use blockchain to disrupt title insurers, which verify property transfers, Yusko said. Blockchain, the technology bitcoin is built on, is a tamper-proof digital ledger that records transactions without the need of a middleman.  ""Title insurance — it's just a stupid business. Why do we need to pay $1,000?"" Yusko asked. Day-trading crypto is dangerous Despite their enthusiasm, Crypto investors do acknowledge that the price of bitcoin and other digital currencies can be too extreme for the average person to trade. Countless retail investors lost money when they bought bitcoin near its high of nearly $20,000 in late 2017. Today, it trades at barely $3,000.  ""We're not day-traders. I have zero interest of picking up pennies in front of bulldozers,""  said Tom Serres, co-founder at Animal Ventures, a firm that invests in tech startups and the crypto infrastructure. Scott Kupor, managing partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, said his firm is searching for investments in the infrastructure of cryptocurrencies. In 2012, Andreessen Horowitz backed CoinBase, the popular US crypto exchange. The company is now reportedly valued at about $8 billion.  Kupor stressed that cryptocurrencies are still in their infancy and will evolve tremendously over the coming years, creating opportunities along the way.  ""We are in the seed investment stage,"" Kupor said. ""The first iterations look silly. They never work ... The investment opportunities are the ones that solve the problems.""

148,2019-10-10 00:00:00,2019,10.0,10,Kevin Liptak,Trump says he 'doesn't know' Giuliani's Ukrainian associates,"Washington (CNN)For Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, becoming powerful Republican donors didn't take very long.  With almost no record of political giving before February 2018, the two men found themselves posing for photographs with President Donald Trump and meeting for breakfast with the President's son within a few months of their first donations to GOP campaigns. Federal prosecutors said Thursday those donations were actually funded by foreign nationals -- and that Parnas and Fruman illegally funneled the funds through a company meant to conceal its origins. Before that, though, Parnas and Fruman appeared to be enjoying the fruits of their efforts, mingling with powerful politicians and fostering at least the impression they were close to the President. In photos posted to a now-inactive Facebook page, Parnas and Fruman frequently sought to tout a close relationship to the President, his family and his advisers -- including Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani. On Thursday, Trump acknowledged there was a photo with the now-arrested men. But he said he didn't know them and had nothing to do with their alleged crimes. ""I don't know those gentlemen. Now it's possible I have a picture with them because I have a picture with everybody, I have a picture with everybody here,"" Trump said, adding that someone told him there ""may be"" a photo with them ""at a fundraiser or somewhere, but I have pictures with everybody."" He continued, ""I don't know them. I don't know about them. I don't know what they do but I don't know, maybe they were clients of Rudy. You'd have to ask Rudy, I just don't know."" Pressed whether he is concerned Giuliani himself could be indicted, Trump said, ""Well I hope not, again, I don't know how he knows these people."" Parnas and Fruman are clients of Giuliani's, and have been helping him in his efforts to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. They were arrested at Dulles Airport on Wednesday evening with one-way tickets to Europe. A year-and-a-half ago, both men were making forays into high-dollar Republican politics. Fruman attended a fundraiser for Trump's re-election campaign at the President's Mar-a-Lago estate in March 2018, an event where tickets began at $2,700 and went all the way to $50,000.  A few months later, after attending an event for America First Action, a pro-Trump super PAC, at the Trump International Hotel in Washington in April 2018, Parnas posted photos and video -- including an image of his personalized dinner menu, which featured a wedge salad. ""Feeling fantastic,"" he wrote alongside the photos, which also featured Fruman. ""Thank you President Trump !!! Making America great !!!!!!incredible dinner and even better conversation."" He tagged the photo at the White House, though the images appear to be from Trump's hotel property a few blocks away. In the following days, he posted photos with a number of high-profile Republican lawmakers, appearing to make the rounds on Capitol Hill with key lawmakers and documenting his efforts on social media. A few weeks later, Parnas posted a photo from a breakfast meeting with Donald Trump Jr. at the Polo Lounge, the candy-striped restaurant in the lobby of the Beverly Hills Hotel. ""Power breakfast !!!"" he captioned the image, in which he's shown smiling widely alongside Fruman settled into a round, green-upholstered booth. People familiar with the matter said that was the two men's first encounter with Trump's son, who met Parnas and Fruman through his close friend Tommy Hicks Jr. Hicks is pictured alongside the men at the Polo Lounge. Hicks Jr. used to be the chairman for America First Action, the committee Parnas and Fruman donated $325,000 to last May. Prosecutors say the donation was designed to ""evade the reporting requirements"" written in federal law. Hicks has since left the super PAC to become Republican National Committee co-chairman, creating a vacancy filled by Linda McMahon, who stepped down as Trump's Small Business Administration head in spring 2019 to join the group. She is now in charge of soliciting donors.  In a statement on Thursday, a spokeswoman for America First Action said the group placed the donation from Parnas and Fruman ""in a segregated bank account"" and that it hadn't been used ""for any purpose."" ""The funds will remain in this segregated account until these matters are resolved,"" the statement said. Like their associate Rudy Giuliani, both Parnas and Fruman were frequently seen at Trump properties, including the Trump International Hotel in Washington. It was there they were spotted on Wednesday with Giuliani, according to the Wall Street Journal, before making their way to Dulles Airport and their ultimate arrest. Now, photos of a different type illustrate the men's predicament: unsmiling mug shots taken at the Alexandria, Virginia, sheriff's office.

149,2018-05-19 00:00:00,2018,5.0,19,By Jamie Crawford,US withdrawing aid from northwest Syria," (CNN)The United States is withdrawing assistance from northwest Syria as the Trump administration reviews hundreds of millions of dollars in stabilization aid to Syria, a State Department official has told CNN. The withdrawal of assistance comes as the US-led military coalition battles the remaining elements of ISIS in the Middle Euphrates River Valley along the Syrian border of Iraq. ""Two-hundred million dollars of stabilization assistance for Syria is currently under review at the request of the President,"" the official said in a statement to CNN. ""Distinct from that amount, U.S. assistance for programs in northwest Syria are being freed up to provide potential increased support for priorities in northeast Syria, as will be determined by the outcome of the ongoing assistance review, including the D-ISIS campaign and stabilization efforts."" While the US-led coalition has cleared the country's northwestern region of ISIS, al Qaeda-linked groups such as the Nusra Front still maintain a foothold there, and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government has been consolidating gains in territory there that it had lost to rebel forces, raising questions about what the US withdrawal of aid will mean for Syria's future. President Donald Trump has repeatedly said it is time for Arab allies in the region to take responsibility for Syria in order to allow the United States to focus on priorities on the home front. But there is concern that a withdrawal of US development and reconstruction aid could curtail American influence to reach an outcome in line with longer-term US interests. The development ultimately could benefit ""the Russians and other actors in that region, like the Iranians,"" by allowing them more influence in the long-term, said retired Air Force Col. Cedric Leighton, a CNN military analyst. The lack of US involvement in northwest Syria could also give terrorist groups like the Nusra Front a base from which to mount terror operations and exploit the volatile political situation to their benefit, Leighton said. CBS News first reported the withdrawal of the aid. The move to review stabilization efforts across Syria could also complicate the effort to assist in the country's reconstruction and any related leverage over a political solution to the civil war. ""It is clear that Russia's interests in Syria are Russia's interest and not those of the wider international community,"" Gen. Joseph Votel, who oversees US military operations across the Middle East as head of US Central Command, told a congressional committee earlier this year. Trump said last month he was eyeing a conclusion of the US military campaign in Syria, where about 2,000 troops are working to finish off the remaining elements of ISIS. Defense Secretary James Mattis and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joseph Dunford have both warned against a hasty withdrawal from Syria like the 2011 pull-out from Iraq that helped create the conditions that allowed ISIS to take over a sizable portion of the country in 2014. There is also concern about how US military allies on the ground in Syria, who were instrumental in reclaiming ISIS-held territory, would view a precipitous withdrawal of US investment in Syria. Such a move would ""reverberate for decades to come that the United States is not a trusted partner,"" Leighton said, adding that US commitments in the region could be seen as temporary, thereby ""limiting the ability of the United States to project power"" in the region going forward.

150,2019-03-08 00:00:00,2019,3.0,8,Blake Ellis,New Parkinson's psychosis drug target of DOJ probe," (CNN)The US Department of Justice has launched an investigation into the sales and marketing of a drug approved three years ago to help treat Parkinson's patients suffering from debilitating psychosis. The drug's maker, Acadia Pharmaceuticals, disclosed the investigation in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Citing a desperate need for a seriously ill population, the Food and Drug Administration approved Nuplazid in 2016 despite a conclusion from the government's medical reviewer that the benefits of the antipsychotic medication didn't outweigh its risks. It is the only drug on the market approved to combat hallucinations and delusions in Parkinson's patients. In November SEC filings, Acadia said it had received a civil investigative demand, or CID, requesting certain documents and information under the False Claims Act, which the federal government uses to recoup fraudulent gains. The company said it had received the CID in September. It did not provide details, to CNN or in its filings, about what prompted the investigation. Acadia said it is fully cooperating with the government's request and that it will continue to do so. ""ACADIA is committed to a culture of compliance and we foster business practices grounded in responsible and ethical behavior intended to fully comply with applicable laws and regulations,"" the company said in a statement to CNN. It also said that ""nothing is more important to [the company] than the well-being of the people who use NUPLAZID."" The DOJ did not comment. The origins and focus of this specific investigation have not been made public, and False Claims Act experts interviewed by CNN said DOJ inquiries like this do not necessarily mean the government already has strong evidence of wrongdoing and can often take years to be resolved. Health care fraud attorneys and professors say the majority of false claims investigations start with lawsuits filed by whistleblowers alleging wrongdoing in the hopes the government will join the case and take action against the company or individuals. If successful, these cases can result in payouts for the whistleblowers and are kept under seal until the government has time to investigate the allegations and decide whether to intervene.  The False Claims Act can be used in health care fraud cases, including those involving either allegations of kickbacks to doctors or off-label marketing, according to the federal government. It is illegal for pharmaceutical salespeople to tout a medication for unapproved uses. And while pharmaceutical companies are allowed to pay a doctor to promote a drug to colleagues and other medical professionals, doctors cannot prescribe the drug in exchange for payments from a manufacturer -- known as kickbacks. Some of these investigations end with no government action, while others have led to multimillion-dollar settlements and penalties. ""CIDs are unfortunately common — but in the same way that health care fraud is unfortunately common. They signal that DOJ is aware of credible allegations of fraud,"" said Jim Barger, an attorney who specializes in False Claims Act litigation and a professor at the University of Alabama School of Law.   ""Companies and investors should take CIDs very seriously and proceed with caution. They are not to be shrugged off as some routine inquiry."" Former DOJ attorney Jacob Elberg, who led the health care and government fraud unit of the New Jersey US attorney's office, said that False Claims Act investigations often look at sales and marketing materials, correspondence between salespeople and doctors, as well as payments made to prescribers of the drug. Payments to doctors Government data specifically tracks prescriptions which are paid for through the Medicare Part D prescription drug program for people 65 and over and the disabled. The program releases public data showing the doctors who wrote more than 10 Medicare Part D prescription drug claims for a given medication each year. Separate government data also tracks payments made to physicians by pharmaceutical companies, as well as free travel, food and drink provided by the company. The online dashboard displaying this data compares each doctor's total non-research-related payments to the national average of roughly $3,300 and median of around $156 in 2017. A CNN analysis of these two public datasets shows that of the 170 Medicare Part D prescribers who had filed more than 10 Nuplazid prescription claims in 2016, the year it hit the market, around 25% were listed as paid consultants in the current government payment data. When asked by CNN what these doctors were being paid to do, Acadia said it previously misclassified many of its payments in the government data. It has since submitted updated figures to Medicare -- saying that many of these physicians were paid by the company to speak about the drug and Parkinson's Disease Psychosis (PDP). It said this corrected data results in less than 25% of the 170 prescribers being either paid consultants or speakers for the company, but would not provide CNN with the specific payment information, which will not be available to the public until summer. Read Acadia's statement More than 10% of all Medicare Part D claims for Nuplazid -- adding up to more than $2.1 million -- came from these physicians, according to an analysis of the currently available data conducted by CNN. While it makes sense for a drug company like Acadia to work with doctors who are familiar with the medication it sells and no one data point on its own can tell the whole story, several health care fraud experts said the company's relationship with top prescribers would be of interest to the DOJ. In response to the figures, Acadia said that ""a large number of prescribers account for the vast majority of prescriptions."" The company also highlighted that payments to doctors averaged $380 in 2016 and $1,225 in 2017. Using its own analysis of 1,448 physicians and other medical professionals who prescribed Nuplazid in 2016, Acadia said 95% received ""nominal"" transfers of value, which the company defined as $125 or less (which it said is its spending limit for one physician dinner and ancillary costs), or nothing at all. These doctors, it said, wrote more than 80% of total Medicare prescriptions for the drug. Acadia said this group was ""representative of all prescribers,"" though it did not include everyone who had prescribed the drug. Medicare data about the doctors who prescribed Nuplazid in 2017 is not yet available, but doctor payment data is. This shows that 26 doctors received six-figure payments (including financial compensation, free food, drink and travel) in 2017 -- all related to Acadia's sole drug, Nuplazid. CNN reached out to a number of these recipients to ask what work they did in exchange for payments, but so far none have responded. In total, Acadia spent more than $8 million on payments to doctors, including covered meals and travel. The highest paid physician in 2017 (the drug's first full year on the market) received nearly $200,000 in that single year. The Southern Investigative Reporting Foundation highlighted these payments to doctors last year as part of a report that called Acadia's marketing into question. Acadia said most of the 2016 and 2017 payments were for speaking events used to spread awareness about the drug and its use in treating PDP. The company said Its educational activities ""play a critical role in advancing patient care and help ensure NUPLAZID is used in a safe and effective manner"" and that it has policies to ensure that these interactions are in compliance with the law. It noted that payments decreased by 46% last year to $4.7 million, as public data will show when it is released this summer, and said that more than 13,000 practitioners have prescribed the drug since its launch in 2016. ""Our interactions and engagements with health care professionals are for legitimate purposes,"" Acadia said, noting they are conducted in accordance with industry standards. When a medication is new, aimed at a niche market and the only approved drug for a given population, companies may spend more to hire doctors who can educate colleagues about the drug and the condition it treats. Still, the health care fraud attorneys and professors CNN spoke with said the amount of money Acadia has paid to doctors is surprising and that investigators would want to see evidence of the specific work they did in exchange for the six-figure payments. ""That's a huge amount of money to have that many people getting, and that huge amount of money is certainly something that would raise red flags,"" said Elberg, who is now a professor at Seton Hall University School of Law. Inside the FDA's recent safety evaluation  Nuplazid's review by the FDA was expedited because the drug had been designated a ""breakthrough"" medication — meaning the agency deemed it demonstrated ""substantial improvement"" in patients with serious conditions compared to treatments already on the market. In a CNN report last year on a high number of deaths reported to the FDA about patients taking Nuplazid, some physicians and medical researchers worried the drug was approved too quickly, based on too little evidence that it was safe and effective. CNN has heard from several family members who say the drug helped tame their loved ones' hallucinations with few apparent side effects, and several prescribing physicians have said they don't have any concerns about the drug and have welcomed an FDA-approved option for such a difficult condition. Other people have questioned whether Nuplazid contributed to their family member's decline or death or said the drug didn't work. After the CNN report, the FDA completed a new safety evaluation into Nuplazid and announced in September that the review had not identified any ""new or unexpected"" risks or findings inconsistent with the drug's current warning label. As a result, the agency determined no changes to the label, which includes the FDA's most severe black box warning, were necessary. In underlying review documents, recently obtained by CNN, the FDA's Division of Psychiatry Products attributed the ""large number of reported deaths"" on an already sick population and a distribution system that made it more likely the company would learn of deaths, which it is required to pass along to the FDA. The company distributes Nuplazid through a network of specialty pharmacies that allow them to be in more frequent contact with both patients and caregivers. ""If the reporting rate from the specialty pharmacy channel were as low as it was from other channels, the overall mortality reporting rate would be 88% lower,"" an FDA official wrote. In its statement to CNN, Acadia cited this conclusion from the FDA about how an already sick population of end-stage Parkinson's Disease patients and Nuplazid's distribution system have contributed to the reports of death and other adverse events. The company says it is committed to ""rigorous and ongoing safety monitoring and reporting."" ""We are confident in NUPLAZID's efficacy and positive benefit/risk profile as described in the FDA approved label and stand firmly behind it,"" Acadia said. It pointed out that the Movement Disorder Society has listed it as the only drug that is both ""efficacious"" and has an acceptable risk without specialized monitoring, when compared to other drugs that are not approved for PDP but are commonly used to treat it. Acadia has provided grant funding to this organization, which the company says was used for educational events and was unrelated to the report that came to this conclusion. One of the authors of the paper, however, told CNN he has received payments as a consultant for the company and sits on its scientific advisory board -- a relationship the journal did not deem a conflict based on his contributions.  Nuplazid's current black box warning cautions that there is ""increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis."" Nuplazid is only approved to treat Parkinson's Disease Psychosis, or PDP. It is not approved to treat dementia. But this same boxed warning was required on Nuplazid because of the data presented during the approval process of the drug showing that the risk of death among PDP patients taking Nuplazid was similar to that of dementia patients taking antipsychotics. So even though the black box warning is specifically worded for dementia patients, the FDA confirmed to CNN that it is intended to apply to PDP patients as well. That means prescribers and patients should be aware that those with PDP are also at an ""increased risk of death"" as described in the warning label. Acadia says that patients, caregivers and prescribers need to consider Nuplazid's label and black box warning in the context of each patient's ""assessed benefit /risk and other factors"" -- including their age and the severity of their condition.

151,2018-05-30 00:00:00,2018,5.0,30,Jeremy Herb,War between Trump and FBI puts Gowdy in delicate spot,"Washington (CNN)In a tense March meeting in the basement of the Capitol, Democrats offered scores of motions to keep the House Intelligence Committee's Russia investigation alive, only to get rebuffed time and again by Republicans. Each motion was rejected by the committee on a party-line basis -- except for one: To hold former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon in contempt of Congress for stonewalling the panel. The lone Republican defector was Trey Gowdy, who voted ""present"" on the effort to reject the motion, declining to side with either party on the matter, according to three sources with knowledge of situation. Gowdy had railed on Bannon in private, lashing out at the former White House aide for disclosing information to the author of ""Fire and Fury"" but not providing information during his testimony before the House panel. The episode underscored how Gowdy has positioned himself amid the growing fight between President Donald Trump and investigators looking into Russia meddling. Gowdy, a reliable Republican partisan who led the House's Benghazi investigation in the run-up to the 2016 election, has confounded expectations with his willingness to defend special counsel Robert Mueller and the FBI, culminating in his latest comments undercutting Trump's claims of the FBI placing spies in his campaign. But Gowdy has also been careful to avoid provoking Trump and the White House, declining to issue any subpoenas to the Trump administration as chairman of the House Oversight Committee, ignoring numerous Democratic demands to investigate White House controversies, while working closely with House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes, who has sought to undercut the Justice Department and FBI. While Nunes has leaned on Gowdy to dig through the intelligence to give him ammunition against the probe, Gowdy has appeared uncomfortable at times by that role. Twice in recent weeks, Gowdy pointedly declined to discuss his role in reviewing the intelligence underpinning Trump's claims of a spy in his campaign. ""I do what I'm told,"" Gowdy said to a reporter after he finished up a conversation with a senior Nunes aide. He declined further comment. Keeping both sides guessing Gowdy, a former federal prosecutor, quickly rose through the House Republican ranks in his four terms in Congress before announcing in January that he was not running for re-election, declaring that he was more effective as a lawyer than a lawmaker. He still faces criticism from Democrats for his role leading the Benghazi Select Committee, which they charge was an 18-month partisan investigation into Hillary Clinton, and he was added to the House Intelligence Committee this year as another voice who could wage partisan battles over the Russia probe. The unique position Gowdy has carved has left the partisans on both sides guessing as to where the South Carolina Republican will land as the special counsel investigation -- and the Republican efforts to undercut it -- ratchet up. That was never more apparent after Gowdy's Fox News appearance on Tuesday, in which he said the President and his attorneys were wrong to accuse the FBI of placing a ""spy"" in Trump's presidential campaign. Gowdy was the only lawmaker not on the bipartisan ""Gang of Eight"" -- the leaders of the House and Senate and heads of the intelligence committees -- to receive a classified briefing last week about the FBI's use of a confidential FBI source during the campaign to speak to several members of Trump's team. ""I am even more convinced that the FBI did exactly what my fellow citizens would want them to do when they got the information they got, and that it has nothing to do with Donald Trump,"" Gowdy said on Fox News. ""President Trump himself in the Comey memos said if anyone connected with my campaign was working with Russia, I want you to investigate it, and it sounds to me like that is exactly what the FBI did,"" Gowdy added. ""I think when the President finds out what happened, he is going to be not just fine, he is going to be glad that we have an FBI that took seriously what they heard."" Democrats seized on Gowdy's comments, which he reiterated on CBS News Wednesday morning, as proof that Trump's unproven spying conspiracy was debunked. ""We now live in a kind of alternate universe when individual Republicans get massive praise just for acknowledging the obvious and restating basic facts,"" said Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee. Trump tweeted about Gowdy's comments but he focused on Gowdy questioning Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and not the confidential source. Why Gowdy was invited to the Justice Department briefing Gowdy's statements were not the first time he's raised questions about the attacks from Trump and conservatives on the FBI, the Justice Department and the special counsel. He's repeatedly defended Mueller's ability to finish his investigation, and in March, Gowdy criticized the President's then-lawyer, John Dowd, for comments urging Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to end the Mueller probe. ""If you have an innocent client, Mr. Dowd, act like it,"" Gowdy said on ""Fox News Sunday."" Gowdy has played a key role in the House Intelligence Committee's Russia investigation and Nunes' separate investigation into the Justice Department. He's has been designated to read sensitive, classified documents for the committee's majority, both when the Justice Department said only one Republican member could read them, as well as when Nunes elected not to view the documents himself. But as Nunes has used the briefings to make the case that the Russia investigation should never have been started in the first place, Gowdy has tried to make the case that Mueller should be given space to conduct the investigation. It was Gowdy's role that got him invited to the Justice Department briefing last week on the confidential FBI source, which occurred amid accusations from Trump and his allies that the FBI placed a spy in his campaign. CNN has reported that the confidential FBI source was not in fact infiltrating the campaign, but spoke with campaign aides who were suspected of ties to Russia. While Gowdy said the FBI acted appropriately Tuesday evening, just minutes later Trump repeated the unproven spy claim at a rally in Tennessee.  ""So how do you like the fact the fact they had people infiltrating our campaign? Can you imagine?"" Trump said. Gowdy's curious congressional comments Nunes has not spoken publicly since the briefing occurred. But if he disagrees with Gowdy's assessment, it wouldn't be the first time. Documents that Gowdy has reviewed for the committee, for instance, formed the basis of Nunes' memo accusing the Justice Department of abusing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act process through the use of an unverified opposition research dossier on Trump and Russia. The memo is one of the points Trump's allies make to argue that Mueller's probe is illegitimate. Gowdy said after the memo was released publicly that the dossier was not necessary for the investigation into Trump's team and Russia.  ""There is a Russia investigation without a dossier,"" Gowdy said on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" in February. And when the House Intelligence Committee Republicans released their final report in March that disputed the intelligence community's assessment that Russian President Vladimir Putin was trying to help Trump get elected, Gowdy disagreed. ""It is also clear, based on the evidence, Russia had disdain for Secretary Clinton and was motivated in whole or in part by a desire to harm her candidacy or undermine her presidency had she prevailed,"" Gowdy said. In fact, Gowdy has in recent weeks made the odd argument as a lawmaker that congressional investigations themselves are problematic. ""Executive Branch investigations are more publicly confidence-inspiring than current congressional investigations,"" Gowdy said in March when he joined calls for a second special counsel to probe FBI and DOJ actions. ""We leak like the Gossip Girls."" Dems say Gowdy fails to conduct oversight of White House As chairman of the House Oversight Committee, Gowdy has faced pressure from the top Democrat on the committee, Cummings, to investigate a range of White House controversies. They say he has showed little interest in pursuing unanswered questions from the White House, whether it's on travel on private jets, its role in the response to the hurricanes last year, as well the deadly 2017 raid in Niger that killed four American soldiers. Democrats say it's a far cry from the hard-charging Benghazi investigation, pointing to when federal marshals served Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal with a subpoena in 2015. ""It is time for Congress to start conducting its own independent and credible oversight of the Trump administration rather than walling off the White House from scrutiny,"" Cummings said. An oversight committee aide said Gowdy hasn't issued subpoenas because he has been able to bring witnesses in voluntarily, pointing to Justice Department official John Gore appearing earlier this month amid questions about the census after Gowdy threatened subpoena him. Democrats, however, say Gore still refused to answer key questions. Gowdy argued that subpoenas won't get him the information he's seeking. ""I know you guys like subpoenas because it's Latin for drama. I want the information,"" Gowdy told CNN in April when asked about a recent Democratic call for a White House subpoena. ""I'm considering getting the information by whatever means I can get it."" ",https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/30/politics/trey-gowdy-donald-trump-fbi/index.html,politics,CNN
152,2019-07-15 00:00:00,2019,7.0,15,Chris Cillizza,Joe Biden just made a giant gamble on health care," (CNN)Joe Biden is making a very big bet on the status quo. That's true for his 2020 presidential campaign generally (his argument is that Donald Trump's election is a fever dream from which the GOP -- and the country -- will awake) but especially true on the issue that has proven decisive in a majority of elections in recent memory: Health care. On Monday, Biden rolled out his health care plan which, while it does many new-ish things, is best described as Obamacare Plus. Biden's plan takes the Affordable Care Act as its foundational principle and builds from there. So there is more money to lower the cost of purchasing insurance -- and a public option similar to Medicare for those who want it. But there is not much that's radical in the Biden proposal, nothing coming anywhere close to the ""Medicare for All"" proposal, which would eliminate the private insurance industry (and the ACA) in favor of a health care system run entirely by the government, supported by at least two of his main rivals for the 2020 Democratic nod. ""We should not be starting from scratch,"" Biden said in New Hampshire on Sunday. ""We should be building from what we have. There's no time to wait."" And in a video released Monday morning to accompany his health care proposal, Biden noted that in the first Democratic debate last month he made clear he opposed getting rid of private health insurance. ""I believe we have to protect and build on Obamacare,"" Biden said in the video. ""I understand the appeal of 'Medicare for All' but folks supporting it should be clear that it means getting rid of Obamacare. And I'm not for that."" Within hours, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the author the ""Medicare for All"" legislation, which is supported by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Kamala Harris (Calif.) among others in the 2020 race, hit back at Biden's plan. Tweeted Sanders: ""I fought to improve and pass Obamacare. I traveled all over the country to fight the repeal of Obamacare. But I will not be deterred from ending the corporate greed that creates dysfunction in our health care system. We must pass Medicare for All."" (The Sanders tweet included a video of Barack Obama calling Medicare for All a ""good new idea."") Biden's willingness to stand up against the Medicare for All forces is a gamble, yes, but it is a calculated one based on a bevy of polling that seems to suggest the former vice president's positioning on the issue is the most popular approach. A recent poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation, which has been tracking views of the ACA for years now, affirms the Biden position. The ACA is viewed favorably by 46% of the country while 40% have an unfavorable view of the law. (Obamacare's favorable numbers have outpaced its unfavorable ones since almost the minute the former president left office.) Among Democrats, the law is even more popular; 79% view it favorably while just 12% regard it unfavorably. Kaiser also asked Democratic and Democratic-leaning respondents what specific part of the health care debate they wanted the 2020 candidates to address in the first debates of the presidential campaign. (The poll came out last month, just before the two-night extravaganza in Miami.) More than a quarter -- 28% -- said that lowering the cost of health care was what they wanted to hear from the candidates most about. About half that number (15%) said they wanted to hear the candidates discuss implementing a single-payer or Medicare for All system. Importantly -- and potentially problematically for Biden -- that question broke down along ideological lines. Among self-identified liberals, 23% said they wanted to hear more from the candidates about implementing Medicare for All. That number was just 9% among moderates. The coming (or maybe it's already here) health care fight in the 2020 Democratic race is indicative of the broader scuffle within the party between incremental and radical change. Biden has proudly embraced the view that Trump's presidency requires not a blowing up of the political system but rather a reinvestment in it by good-hearted public servants. Sanders and Warren (and, sort of, Harris) believe that Trump's presidency is a feature, not a glitch of Republican politics -- and that the only response to these four years of Trump is to destroy the very political system that allowed him to be elected president. Biden's message is one that Republicans fear could lure many of their voters -- already wary of Trump -- in a general election. And almost all general election polling done in the race suggest the former vice president is not only the strongest potential Democratic nominee against the incumbent but would start that race with a statistically significant lead. But his problem may be -- emphasis on may be -- that in a Democratic primary, particularly in the year 2020 and with Donald Trump sitting in the White House, the party's most active voters want to support candidates advocating for massive, structural change rather than incremental fixes. Biden's belief is that there won't be enough of those big change voters to cancel out the incrementalists -- on health care or in the race more generally. Like I said, it's a big gamble -- and one that if he bets wrong could well cost him the nomination.

153,2019-06-13 00:00:00,2019,6.0,13,Ellie Kaufman,Wildfires in California: Feds warn about upcoming season ,"Washington (CNN)US Forest Service and Interior Department officials warned senators Thursday that the upcoming wildfire season would be worse than last year's, which left dozens of people dead in California, saying that ""if we're lucky, this year will simply be a challenging one."" ""It's hard to imagine a repeat of this experience, but this is the potential reality that we face again this year,"" said Jeff Rupert, director of the Office of Wildland Fire for the Interior Department, during his opening remarks at a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing. ""So it's difficult for me to sit here this morning and say that a challenging year is ahead of us because the wildfires that we're now experiencing are consistently more destructive than they've ever been."" Rupert went on to recount some of harsh statistics from the end of last year's season which ravaged parts of the west. Eighty-five people died from November's Camp Fire, the deadliest wildfire in California's history. The fire virtually burned the town of Paradise to the ground, destroying thousands of homes and structures, and has cost billions of dollars in economic losses. Rupert and Shawna Legarza, the director of fire aviation and management for the US Forest Service, spoke before the committee about how the federal government and Congress plan to manage potential threats from the upcoming wildfire season. ""We know that our predictive services is showing that it's going to start to increase, that we could have a very significant fire year again,"" Legarza said during her opening statement. ""This year in California and the Pacific Northwest, all those grasses are going to be drying out from the heavy rains and snowpack, and with that will come large fires. So we must continue to be prepared."" Both the Interior Department and US Department of Agriculture's Forest Service provide government assistance during wildfire season. Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said the upcoming wildfire season will have ""elevated wildfire activity,"" from June through September, according to a National Interagency Fire Center monthly wildland fire potential outlook released in early June.  ""Some observers believe the stage is set for fire activity similar to the indescribable damage and staggering loss of life that we saw last year in Northern California,"" Murkowski said during her opening remarks. Murkowski noted that there has been an uptick in wildfires across the country in the last week alone. She mentioned wildfires that have already started in her home state, Alaska, as well as parts of Arizona. The senator cited some reasons for the uptick in wildfires over the past few years, including climate change, unhealthy landscapes that are overstocked with ""excess fuels"" and disease and insect outbreaks which leave trees behind that are ""ready to ignite just like a matchstick,"" she said. Democratic West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, the ranking member of the committee, said wildfires are ""burning longer"" and ""they are harder to control than just a few years ago.""

154,2018-05-02 00:00:00,2018,5.0,2,By Ernest Owens ,We need to stop giving Kanye a platform to lie (opinion) ,"Ernest Owens is the editor of Philadelphia magazine's G Philly and CEO of Ernest Media Empire, LLC. He has written for USA Today, NBC News, BET, HuffPost and several other major publications. Follow him on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. The views expressed here are solely his.  (CNN)There are opinions, and then there are facts. As the saying goes, people are entitled to their own version of the former, but not the latter.  A fact: Centuries of slavery in America were the consequence of the capturing and abusing of countless black people by white people, which led to more institutional racism and systemic oppression following emancipation. An opinion based on a lie: ""When you hear about slavery for 400 years ... for 400 years? That sounds like a choice."" So Kanye West said during a TMZ interview on Tuesday.  ""Like, you was there for 400 years and it's all of y'all? It's like we're mentally in prison. I like the word 'prison' because slavery goes too direct to the idea of blacks. It's like slavery, Holocaust. Holocaust, Jews. Slavery is blacks. So, prison is something that unites us as one race. Blacks and whites being one race. We're the human race,"" West continued.  Yes, West is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts. Suggesting that 400 years of slavery ""sounds like a choice"" is simply not an opinion based in truth. Anyone who chooses to seek any fact in his statement is abandoning reason altogether. But this is where the cult of celebrity has gotten us. Our President, a former reality television star, has a hard time separating fact from fiction -- and now his new fan Kanye clearly does too. While President Trump's position makes it harder to shut down his questionable statements, it shouldn't be too difficult to do that for West. It's time Americans of conscience seriously reconsider the role we play in giving celebrities a platform to espouse lies -- especially at a time when everyone needs the truth more than ever. Fortunately, TMZ's Van Lathan stepped in to set the rapper straight on the difference between opinion and fact, telling West: ""I think what you're doing right now is actually the absence of thought and the reason why I feel like that is because, Kanye, you're entitled to your opinion."" More fans of Kanye now need to follow Lathan's lead. Like many, I was once a fan of West. I found many of his outspoken antics to come from a place rooted in truth. When he once proclaimed in 2005 that former president George W. Bush ""doesn't care about black people,"" he spoke to the frustration many black Americans and others felt when the Bush administration appeared incompetent in dealing with the aftermath of the Hurricane Katrina disaster that devastated New Orleans and surrounding Gulf Coast communities.  Despite Kanye's brash approach, I understood the context of his criticism of Taylor Swift's beating out Beyonce during the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. Many critics still remember the cultural impact of Beyonce's ""Single Ladies"" video over Swift's ""You Belong With Me"" visuals.  But West's latest rants on Twitter have lacked the ""genius"" label many once associated with him. His messaging is scattered -- a combination of historical fiction mixed with personal self-exploration and possible publicity-seeking. West doubled down on his defense of his TMZ interview, tweeting that ""once again I am being attacked for presenting new ideas."" Thankfully, many on social media have finally had enough. By Tuesday night, #IfSlaveryWasAChoice was trending worldwide on Twitter, calling out West and others who still entertain falsehoods about slavery.  As I saw many of the tweets mocking West, I grew annoyed that we're even having this conversation in the first place. In 2018, it's backwards that America would even be engaging in debates about the undeniable facts surrounding slavery.  And then I looked back at the source: Kanye West. The time has come to stop amplifying his platform when he continues to misconstrue facts and distract the public from truth. Shutting him down is not a matter of censoring opinions; it's a matter of being responsible in how we elevate or endorse the cult of celebrity in situations that further espouse toxic lies. At this point, any outlet that continues to allow Kanye West a platform to knowingly speak such misinformation is either enabling the former or exploiting his celebrity status for ratings. Discrediting the impact of slavery is not a topic we should treat as a wacky entertainment fodder but one with real sensitivity and ethics. I'm no longer enlightened by West's brand of ""new ideas,"" because such oppressive thinking is as old as slavery itself. Perhaps Kanye should spend less time on Twitter striving to provoke, and invest more time in a history class where he can do something many of would prefer -- listen to facts.

155,2020-02-26 00:00:00,2020,2.0,26,Gregory Krieg,Elizabeth Warren says she's ready to run until convention even if she's behind in delegates," (CNN)Elizabeth Warren said Wednesday that she is ready for a convention floor battle this summer if none of the Democratic candidates reaches a delegate majority during the primaries. The senator from Massachusetts made it clear at a CNN town hall in South Carolina that she would be willing to lobby superdelegates, who have votes on the second ballot if there's no outright winner, when asked if she would continue her candidacy even if she were trailing in the delegate count. Asked by an audience member why the person who gets the most votes shouldn't be awarded the nomination, Warren said the rules set a higher bar -- and that she intended to fight to the last. Warren also suggested that the argument by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont that a candidate with a plurality should be declared the nominee was disingenuous, noting that his 2016 campaign, despite losing to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, publicly argued that convention superdelegates should consider swinging the contest in his favor. In the aftermath of that primary, in which the superdelegates overwhelmingly backed Clinton, Sanders and others struck a deal to dilute their power. Unlike four years ago, they will be able to vote only on a second ballot in 2020. But in this crowded field, that compromise could come back to bite Sanders. ""The way I see this is, you write the rules before you know where everybody stands. And then you stick with those rules. So for me, Bernie had a big hand in writing these rules. I didn't write them,"" Warren said. ""When they were putting together the 2016 platform for the Democratic convention, those are the rules he wanted to write. And others wanted to write. Everybody got in the race thinking that was the set of rules,"" she added. ""I don't see how come you get to change it just because he now thinks there's an advantage to him for doing it."" CNN's Don Lemon followed up and asked the senator, ""To be clear, would you continue your fight for the Democratic nomination even if another candidate arrived at the convention ahead of you in the delegate count?  ""Yes,"" Warren responded.  ""Because a lot of people made $5 contributions to my campaign to keep me in it,"" she said when pressed by Lemon.  The senator said that after a recent Democratic debate, ""We raised $9 million in three days, from just folks who said I'll pitch in $5 or $25. They are the heart and soul of the race."" ""I made the decision when I got in I was not going to spend 70% of my time raising money from billionaires and corporate executives and lobbyists. I was going to spend 100% of my time with folks,"" Warren said.  ""As long as they want me to stay in this race, I'm staying in this race,"" she said. ""That, and I've done a lot of pinky promises out there. So I've got to stay in this. I told little girls we persist.""  ",https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/26/politics/elizabeth-warren-convention-superdelegates/index.html,politics,CNN
156,2018-01-20 00:00:00,2018,1.0,20,Jennifer Agiesta,"CNN Poll: Economic boost buoys Trump, but negatives abound elsewhere","WASHINGTON (CNN)One year in to Donald Trump's time in office, his approval ratings fall well below his predecessors' anniversary marks, and Americans' expectations that he will keep major campaign promises have largely faded, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. But the President appears to be reaping some benefits from the best ratings of the economy since Bill Clinton occupied the Oval Office.  Trump's numbers have rebounded from fall lows in overall approval (40%, up from 35% in December), approval on handling the economy (49%, up from 44% in December), approval on handling taxes (42%, up from 34% in December), and confidence in his ability to serve as President (59% say they've lost confidence in him since he took office, down from 64% saying the same in November).  Those shifts, including the improvement in impressions of Trump's handling of the presidency and the economy, stem largely from rebounds among independents. Trump's 52% approval rating on the economy among independents is the only issue area tested where a majority of that group approves of his performance.  The public's perceptions of the economy have climbed dramatically since Trump took office. Overall, 69% now describe it in good shape, the highest since February 2001 and up 12 points since last January. The 20% who currently call the economy ""very good"" is the highest since the final week of Bill Clinton's time in office in January 2001.  Almost half, 47%, say their personal financial situation is better than it was a year ago, about double the share who say their fortunes have worsened in the last year (23%). The overall improvement in ratings of the economy over the last year is driven largely by shifts among Republicans. It is typical for people of the president's party to rate the economy more highly than do those of the party out of office, but Democrats' high marks for the economy under Barack Obama haven't faded as quickly since the transfer of power as Republicans' and independents' reviews have improved. Over that time, Republicans positive ratings have climbed a whopping 48 points, as independents have ticked up 12 points. Democratic ratings have dropped 13 points in the same time frame.  The economy no longer ranks as the most important problem facing the country. Asked to name the most pressing issue, 18% cite immigration, 17% the economy, and 12% each name a foreign policy concern or an issue with the President himself as the nation's top concern. Just 40% say Trump's policies are moving the nation in the right direction more generally, down from 48% just ahead of his inauguration, and the public is split overall on whether he's doing a good job (46%) or a poor job (48%) keeping the important promises he made during the 2016 campaign. Among his own partisans, 88% say he's doing a good job keeping his most important promises, a touch higher than the 83% of Democrats who said the same about Obama in January 2010.  When asked to assess the likelihood Trump will keep specific major promises, expectations appear to have faded on several of them.  Trump has taken his largest hit on his promise to repeal and replace Obamacare. Just before taking office last year, 82% considered that very or somewhat likely to happen, now, just 54% say the same. Expectations have also dipped significantly on fulfilling his promises to renegotiate NAFTA, and to create jobs in economically-challenged areas. There have been meaningful upticks in the share saying Trump is ""not at all likely"" to reduce the amount of corruption in Washington (from 35% to 43%), get Mexico to reimburse the United States for the cost of a wall along the border (from 46% to 54%) and on the prospects for building that wall in the first place (from 29% to 34%). Looking abroad, just 35% approve of Trump's performance handling foreign affairs, unchanged over the fall, and 65% say leaders of other countries around the world don't have much respect for him. Trump's numbers on that score remain worse than Obama's, George W. Bush's or Clinton's, according to CNN's polling. Even among those who approve of Trump's handling of the presidency more generally, nearly a quarter (24%) say he hasn't gained the respect of other world leaders. On a personal level, Trump's favorability rating stands at a net negative, 40% favorable to 57% unfavorable. That's well below current ratings for both Obama (66% favorable) and Bush (61% favorable), as well as below their favorability numbers near the first anniversary of their inauguration (83% viewed Bush favorably in January of 2002; 58% saw Obama positively in December 2009). Trump outpaces Bush's current numbers, however, among Republicans -- 89% have a favorable view of Trump, 76% of Bush. Many Americans also doubt Trump has much personal regard for people like them. Overall, 46% say they think Trump has no respect at all for people like them. That figure climbs to 81% among blacks, 66% among Hispanics, 55% among women (including 74% among non-white women), and 65% among immigrants. The findings follow reports that Trump described countries in Africa using a negative expletive in an Oval Office meeting earlier this month. The CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS January 14-18 among a random national sample of 1,005 adults reached on landlines or cellphones by a live interviewer. No interviewing was completed on January 16 due to weather conditions at call center locations. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points; it is larger for subgroups.

She is also the Editor of the Journal of Information Technology & Politics. Follow her on Twitter: @laurencopeland0. The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own. View more opinion at CNN.  (CNN)More than two dozen Democrats have campaigned to be the party's nominee for 2020. The field has winnowed considerably, but on the eve of the Iowa caucuses, it's still not clear who will go head-to-head with President Donald Trump in November. Although Joe Biden remains the frontrunner nationally, Bernie Sanders has been rising steadily in recent polls, which has created quite a stir among many Democrats. Polls have consistently shown that beating Trump is viewed as the most important issue for Democrats. Typically, Democrats are twice as likely to support a candidate who can beat Trump even if the candidate doesn't share their views. The Sanders surge has generated concern among some partisans that he may be the most vulnerable Democrat to compete against Trump, given that a majority of Americans have unfavorable views of socialism -- which is associated with the Sanders candidacy. Back in November, discussion of strongly progressive policies such as those backed by Sanders and Elizabeth Warren prompted a warning of sorts from former President Barack Obama, who reminded Democrats that the ultimate goal was to kick Donald Trump out of office and win the presidency. He argued that average Americans do not align ""with certain left-leaning Twitter feeds or the activist wing of our party,"" and cautioned that the Democratic Party's policies must be ""rooted in reality."" Around the same time, Michael Bloomberg announced his candidacy. A businessman and former three-term mayor of New York City, Bloomberg contended that he offered a pragmatic option to voters who want to unseat Donald Trump. He has made defeating Trump the centerpiece of his campaign, referring to the president as ""reckless,"" ""unethical,"" and as representing ""an existential threat to our country and values.""  Given Democrats' appetite to unseat Trump, Bloomberg's pitch, his vast resources and a muddled field of fellow Democrats could see him emerge as the Democrats' surprise choice to take on the president this November.    To the chagrin of some, it is Bloomberg's money that makes him such a formidable candidate. Some Democrats are uncomfortable with Bloomberg's wealth given the party's attention to economic inequality. Still, money is essential in a presidential campaign. To this point, political columnist, John Ellis, predicted that Bloomberg would be able to outspend Trump by a 5-1 margin, but any other Democratic nominee may be outspent by a 2-1 or even 3-1 margin. While we can't know for sure whether Ellis' claims are true, we do know a total of $2.4 billion was spent for the entire 2016 presidential contest. We also know that apart from the other billionaire Democrat in the race, Tom Steyer, Bloomberg has spent 25 percent more than the rest of the Democratic field combined. Keep in mind that Bloomberg isn't even competing in the first four contests. Bloomberg's net worth of $60 billion provides him with virtually unlimited campaign funds. So far, he has hired a staff of more than 800 people and spent well over $200 million, and has taken out a $10 million, 60-second spot during the Super Bowl. Taking a page out of Trump's 2016 campaign, he has made the case that he cannot be bought by special interests. Bloomberg has set his sights directly on the President and has made no bones about trying to get under Trump's skin. At first look, it would appear that Trump and Bloomberg have a lot in common. Both are New Yorkers. Both have identified as Democrats, Independents and Republicans. Both are also billionaires. This latter fact may be a point of contention between the two as they compare fortunes (estimates put Bloomberg's net worth at 17 times greater than Trump's net worth).  Yet, they differ significantly on policy issues such as gun control, immigration reform, abortion and climate change. A stark contrast is also apparent when comparing their temperament.  Bloomberg has gotten the President's attention as Trump recently dubbed him ""Mini Mike,"" and called him a ""clown."" This is exactly the type of attack that suggests Bloomberg should be taken seriously by those who want to beat Trump. The ""Bloomberg Blitz"" is very real and it appears to be paying dividends. He has savagely attacked Trump in a barrage of media ads on television, radio, and social media. He has drawn attention to his campaign with a mischievous Twitter feed during Democratic debates. Additionally, he has set himself apart from the field as a businessman who knows how to get things done in politics. He consistently highlights his electability against Trump, seeking to prove himself to be an alternative to those unconvinced Joe Biden is best suited to compete against the President. As a moderate Democrat, Bloomberg needs Biden to falter a bit in order for voters to give him a closer look. Although he was a late entrant and has yet to compete in a Democratic debate, his support has risen steadily, and recently he has been battling with Elizabeth Warren for third place behind Biden and Sanders in national polls. Bloomberg's more moderate voice would seem to make for an attractive choice in a general election campaign. Our own poll of prospective voters in the key swing states of Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Ohio  -- any three of which are likely needed to win the presidency -- finds that many believe that both parties have veered too far away from the center. When asked their thoughts on this topic, 46% to 50% of Independents agreed that the Republican party has drifted too far to the right and 49% to 53% of Independents agreed that the Democrats have gone too far to the left. These are the voters Bloomberg aims to capture in a November contest.  Within the Democratic party, we found a sizable number -- 25% to 29% -- who believe their own party has veered too far to the left. This suggests Bloomberg has an audience among primary voters, although he faces a lot of competition from Biden, Buttigieg and Klobuchar to woo them.      Bloomberg has skipped campaigning in early states, focusing his attention on getting a bounce on Super Tuesday (March 3). This is a risky strategy and one that has not fared well in the past -- Rudy Giuliani in 2008 and Al Gore in 1988 had similar plans, and neither won the nomination. Bloomberg appears to be better set up than them with his name recognition, enormous wealth, party rules, and his garnering of a number of important party endorsements. In an important change, the Democratic National Committee has eliminated the donor threshold that kept Bloomberg -- and candidates like Cory Booker -- from the debate stage in previous debates. It is possible Bloomberg will make the debate stage in mid-February, just in time for him to make a strong Super Tuesday pitch to voters. Bloomberg's unconventional path to the nomination will undoubtedly require some luck. But if there is murkiness at the top of the field coming out of the first few contests, Bloomberg would have an opportunity to sell himself to an uncertain Democratic electorate.

159,2019-04-01 00:00:00,2019,4.0,1,Danielle Wiener-Bronner,Burger King is testing out the Impossible burger,"New York  (CNN Business)Burger King has a plan to bring in new customers and encourage existing ones to buy more often: Vegetarian Whoppers.  The burger chain announced on Monday that it is testing out Impossible Whoppers, made with plant-based patties from Impossible Foods, in 59 locations in and around St. Louis. If all goes well, Burger King will roll out the Impossible Whopper nationally.  With the Impossible Whopper, Burger King hopes to ""give somebody who wants to eat a burger every day, but doesn't necessarily want to eat beef everyday, permission to come into the restaurants more frequently,"" Chris Finazzo, president of Burger King North America, told CNN Business. It's also a way to encourage vegan and vegetarian eaters to check out Burger King.  The chain has been trying to figure out a way to add a plant-based burger option to its menu for about a year, Finazzo said.  ""There's a lot of interest in plant-based burgers,"" he noted.  Going meatless provides health benefits. The Impossible Whopper has slightly fewer calories than the original, beef-based Whopper, and is very low in cholesterol and has zero trans fats.  ""What [customers] don't want to give up on is flavor,"" Finazzo said.  The Impossible Whopper is supposed to taste just like Burger King's regular Whopper. Unlike veggie burgers, Impossible burger patties are designed to mimic the look and texture of meat when cooked. The plant protein startup recently revealed a new recipe, designed to look and taste even more like meat. That version is being used in Burger King's Impossible Whoppers.  Other fast food and fast casual items are also appealing to eaters with dietary restrictions or preferences. Taco Bell said in January that it's testing out a vegetarian menu board in stores, and Chipotle (CMG) recently expanded its line of diet-based bowls to include vegan and vegetarian options. ""Lifestyle bowls"" launched earlier this year with Whole30 and double protein meals in addition to the keto and paleo bowls. Those promotions highlight items already on the menu at Taco Bell and Chipotle. The Impossible Whopper is new, and it costs more to consumers and to the restaurant. Buyers will pay about $1 more for an Impossible Whopper than a regular Whopper, Finazzo said, which will ""more than offset the cost"" of the Impossible protein.  Impossible products are served at nearly 6,000 US restaurants — including White Castle and Fatburger locations — right now, but the Burger King partnership is a ""milestone"" for the company, said Impossible Foods COO and CFO David Lee.  ""Burger King represents a different scale,"" he said. Lee noted that as the company matures, it should be able to reduce costs for clients like Burger King.  ""The only thing we need to be affordable and at scale versus the incumbent commodity business is time and size,"" he said.

160,2019-05-21 00:00:00,2019,5.0,21,Aftab Ahmed,Exclusive: PNB likely to take control of 2-3 small state-run banks - sources,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s Punjab National Bank is looking to merge with two or three government owned banks that could include Oriental Bank Of Commerce, Andhra Bank and Allahabad Bank, two sources familiar with the situation told Reuters, as New Delhi tries to cut the number of state-owned lenders. This could be the one of the first decisions to be taken by the new government after election results to be announced on May 23. Exit polls showed that the alliance led by India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi could win with a big majority. Banking sector reform is unfinished business from the last five year term of Modi’s government as banks struggle under a huge debt pile than of more than 9 trillion Indian rupees ($130 billion), or nearly 5% of the nation’s gross domestic output. The proposal to merge PNB with 2-3 other banks would be put before the cabinet for its nod, according to a government source. Currently, there are 20 state-run banks following mergers of small banks with State Bank of India and Bank of Baroda, and with IDBI Bank taken over by state-run Life Insurance Corporation. PNB could start the process of taking control of the banks in the next three months, according to the sources, who declined to be named, as they are not authorised to speak to the media. PNB shares fell as much as 4% after Reuters reported the news. Its shares ended down 2.55% at 86.10 rupees on India’s National Stock Exchange on Tuesday. Allahabad Bank fell 2.6% to close at 45.15 rupees a share, while Oriental Bank of Commerce ended down nearly 1% at 95.20 rupees per share. PNB declined to comment, while the other banks did not immediately reply to an email from Reuters seeking further information. India’s finance ministry also declined to comment on the story. To revive the banking sector the government of India has injected about $36 billion of tax payers money in the last five years and also initiated an asset quality review of banks by the central bank. According to another official, the government is considering injecting another $7 billion into state-run banks to help them offer cheaper loans to their customers. The Modi government introduced new bankruptcy resolution rules in 2016 to help with faster resolution of bad loans, but litigation has tied down some big restructuring deals. Only about 5% of the stressed assets of banks have so far been dealt with through the bankruptcy process.

161,2019-06-23 00:00:00,2019,6.0,23,"Sarah  Shearman, Thomson Reuters Foundation",Britain's HSBC to help modern slaves 'rebuild lives' with bank access,"LONDON, June 24 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - British retail bank HSBC UK launched a scheme on Monday to help victims of modern slavery and human trafficking in Britain “rebuild their lives” by giving them access to bank accounts.  The bank, part of the London-listed global finance group , said it had been working with law enforcement and charities to identify people who have escaped slavery and trafficking to whom it can offer its “Survivor Bank” service.  Banks usually require proof of address and identity documents, like passports, to open accounts, which can exclude victims of slavery and trafficking who may have had these documents confiscated or live in safe houses.  “Financial independence is a vital part of this rebuilding process,” Victoria Atkins, Britain’s minister for crime, safeguarding and vulnerability, said in a statement.  The service is believed to be the first of its kind in Britain and could potentially be expanded to other countries, a spokeswoman for HSBC told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  Trained staff in 18 of HSBC’s UK branches in areas identified as having “high potential need”, including London, Birmingham and Manchester, will help the victims set up current accounts.  Britain is home to at least 136,000 modern slaves, according to the Global Slavery Index by human rights group the Walk Free Foundation - a figure 10 times higher than a government estimate from 2013.  Survivor Bank will be offered to people who have been identified through the government’s National Referral Mechanism (NRM), a scheme that identifies victims and gives them support.  About 7,000 suspected slavery victims were identified in Britain last year, up a third on 2017, with labour exploitation the most common form of slavery, ranging from men working in car washes to children forced to carry drugs.  “It is a tragedy that people who have escaped their traffickers can face such a struggle to rebuild their lives,” Stuart Haire, head of HSBC UK’s retail bank, said in a statement.  The scheme was piloted in HSBC branches in Glasgow in Scotland, and Nottingham in central England, between June 2018 and March 2019, helping 24 people set up basic bank accounts, with debit cards and online banking.  Banks have been called upon in recent years to step up the fight against human trafficking and slavery by reporting suspicious transactions and other financial activity that ring alarm bells.  Financial institutions hold data on traffickers and their victims that could play a vital role in combating trafficking, found a 2017 report by the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI).

Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera made the move after a leap in imports of vehicles such as the Suzuki Wagon R, and also increased excise duty on cigarettes after the state raised the salaries of railway workers and some allowances for doctors who had threatened to go on strike. Import duty on hybrid cars with an engine capacity of less than 1,000 cc rises by 425,000 rupees per vehicle to a minimum of 1.25 million rupees ($7,840). “The government needs to find extra money for the additional expenditure incurred because of the recent salary hikes to doctors and railway employees,” M.Ali Hassen, the Director of Information at the Ministry of Finance told Reuters. Small hybrid cars have become highly popular among Sri Lankans, with many taxi operators buying them to replace auto rickshaws known as tuk-tuks. Vehicle imports soared 110.6 percent to $665.9 million in the first five months of this year while those of fuel rose 23 percent from the same period last year to $1.8 billion, central bank data showed. The Sri Lankan rupee has been falling steadily since April and is on course to retest recent historic lows. Traders and analysts forecast it could fall as much as 8 percent for the full year against the dollar as demand for imports surges and exporters hold back on converting their dollar earnings into the local currency. Spot rupee hit an all-time low of 160.17 per dollar on June 20 and is down 4 percent so far this year, after falling 2.5 percent in 2017. A strengthening dollar since mid-April has increased the credit risk of several emerging markets, including Sri Lanka, due to currency depreciation, ratings agency Moody’s said on Wednesday. The Sri Lankan economy grew 3.3 percent in 2017, a 16-year low, and fiscal spending is expected to rise before presidential elections later next year and possible provincial council elections earlier in 2019.

Argentine President Mauricio Macri had converted the ministry into a secretariat in mid-2018 in an effort to slash costs. The government said the ministry’s recreation was necessary “in order to promote the sector and maximize the participation of the different actors involved.” The move could help Macri win votes in the crucial farm sector as he seeks re-election in October, analysts said.

Big U.S. manufacturers and automakers were under pressure after Germany’s Daimler cut its 2018 profit forecast and BMW said it was looking at “strategic options” because of a trade war between the United States and China. Caterpillar lost 2.52 percent and Boeing fell 1.5 percent, with the S&P industrials off 1.19 percent and on track for their seventh fall in eight sessions. “It leads to lack of confidence in the (Trump) administration’s ability to push its economic agenda forward,” said Phil Blancato, CEO of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management in New York. “If confidence is waning because of immigration and tariffs, those two things are putting pressure on the market.” The Trump administration on Wednesday reversed an administration policy that separated children and parents who entered the country illegally at the U.S.-Mexico border. Amazon dropped as much as 1.9 percent after the court ruling, which allows states to force online retailers to collect sales taxes, before paring losses to trade down 1.1 percent. Wayfair lost 1.6 percent, Overstock.com tumbled 7.2 percent, Etsy declined 1.4 percent and Ebay dropped 3.2 percent. “You have seen the tug of war as far as investors are concerned with the trading ranges since the announcement. It would appear it is still to be determined the absolute level of ramifications,” said Eric Wiegand, senior portfolio manager at U.S. Bank Private Wealth Management in New York. Intel also weighed heavily on the S&P 500, down 2.4 percent after Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich resigned following a probe that revealed a past consensual relationship with an employee violated company policy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 196.1 points, or 0.8 percent, to 24,461.7, the S&P 500 lost 17.56 points, or 0.63 percent, to 2,749.76 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 68.56 points, or 0.88 percent, to 7,712.95. The Dow index is heavily affected by industrial companies, and trade concerns pushed it into negative territory for the year earlier this week, with the index on pace for its eighth straight decline. Ford fell 1.35 percent, General Motors dropped 1.98 percent and Tesla lost 4.06 percent. The S&P 500 automobiles and components index slumped 1.79 percent. Energy was the worst-performing sector, down 1.93 percent as oil prices fell ahead of a meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, where producers are expected to boost output. Earnings were a bright spot, with shares of Darden Restaurants surging 14.79 percent and grocer Kroger jumping 9.74 percent after issuing strong quarterly results. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.29-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.58-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

165,2018-03-23 00:00:00,2018,3.0,23,,UPDATE 1-'Human scum and bloodsucker': Bolton's White House appointment fans worries over hawkish record in Asia,"* S.Korean government pledges to work with new U.S. adviser * Officials fear Bolton’s hard-line stances could complicate talks * N.Korea rejected Bolton as negotiating partner in 2003 (Adds details of Bolton’s past work on North Korea, comments from analysts) By Christine Kim and Josh Smith SEOUL, March 23 (Reuters) - Once rejected by North Korea as “human scum,” U.S. President Donald Trump’s latest pick for national security adviser has called for regime change in North Korea, prompting worries in Asia ahead of a historic summit between Washington and Pyongyang. Trump announced in a tweet he was replacing H.R. McMaster with John Bolton, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations who has advocated the use of military force against North Korea and Iran and has previously been rejected as a negotiating partner by Pyongyang. “This is worrisome news,” said Kim Hack-yong, conservative lawmaker and head of the national defence committee of South Korea’s parliament. “North Korea and the United States need to have dialogue but this only fuels worries over whether the talks will ever happen.” At Seoul’s presidential Blue House, which has been forced to navigate between the unpredictable personalities of leaders in both Pyongyang and Washington, officials were circumspect. “Our stance is that if a new road opens, we have to go that path,” a senior Blue House official told reporters. “Bolton has much knowledge on the issues regarding the Korean peninsula and most of all, we know him to be one of the U.S. president’s aides who is trusted.” He said Chung Eui-yong, South Korea’s National Security Office head, had not yet spoken with Bolton and that Chung’s reaction to McMaster’s dismissal was “not bad”. Another administrative official in Seoul expressed regret over the loss of camaraderie McMaster had built with his South Korean counterpart as they had tackled North Korea’s nuclear issue together. Both officials requested not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue. Bolton had described Trump’s plan to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as “diplomatic shock and awe” and said it would be an opportunity to deliver a threat of military action. “I think this session between the two leaders could well be a fairly brief session where Trump says, ‘Tell me you have begun total denuclearisation, because we’re not going to have protracted negotiations. You can tell me right now or we’ll start thinking of something else’”, he told Washington’s WMAL radio station. Former South Korean intelligence official Nam Sung-wook said Trump may not even get the opportunity to deliver that message. “Bolton being tapped for this position makes for a very difficult situation where the U.S.-North Korea summit may not even happen,” he said. “It’s going to be a rocky path even before the summit.” The meeting is supposed to happen by the end of May, but an exact time and place have yet to be settled on. Pyongyang had no immediate comment about Bolton, whose criticism of then-North Korean leader Kim Jong Il and Pyongyang’s human rights record in 2003 spurred state media to call him “human scum and bloodsucker.” North Korean officials would not recognise him as a representative of the U.S. government or talk with him because of his “political vulgarity and psychopathological condition”, state media said at the time. Bolton’s appointment came 10 days after Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, another moderating influence, replacing him with CIA director Mike Pompeo. His appointment will further diminish hope for China and the United States to see eye-to-eye on security issues, according to Shi Yinhong, an expert on China-U.S. relations at Renmin University in Beijing. “What security cooperation with China can there be? Nuclear weapons, North Korea, Taiwan, South China Sea, cyberspace … Where is there hope for cooperation?” Shi said. “Trump and Xi Jinping have spoken in public of the logic of cooperation, but with the negative direction of trade and security cooperation, these words seem more and more empty.” Zhao Tong, an expert on North Korea and nuclear disarmament at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center in Beijing, said Bolton’s previous calls for China to pursue regime change in North Korea, as well as for a reunification of the peninsula under the South Korean government, was “very unrealistic”. “His views on strategic security issues will reinforce the Chinese convictions that it needs to build up its hard power,” Zhao said. Tokyo expressed hopes communication with Washington would go on as normal, with one Japanese government official saying he was “very optimistic” Japan would be able to get along with Bolton as he has many friends inside the Japanese government. Narushige Michishita, a professor at Tokyo’s Graduate Institute for Policy Studies, said Bolton’s toughness could present a hurdle in dealing with Pyongyang. “The problem is that he doesn’t have any flexibility. That’s a negative concern that I have,” Michishita said.

Alphabet subsidiary Sidewalk Labs, which is developing the proposal for the futuristic housing and community development, agreed to scale back plans after privacy experts and other town planners said the technology involved was excessively invasive. It resubmitted its proposal in November. Waterfront Toronto’s Digital Strategy Advisory Panel (DSAP), composed of experts in digital privacy and innovation, remain concerned about the revised plan, however, it said in a report released on Wednesday. The panel has said more clarity is needed on several parts of the proposal, “including but not limited to an explanation of why digital approaches to solutions were chosen over non-digital ones,” panel chair Michael Geist said in a blog post accompanying the report’s release. Asked to comment on the panel’s concerns, Sidewalk Labs spokeswoman Keerthana Rang said in an emailed statement that the technology incorporated into the proposed development would be in line with what is already in use for Toronto residents, and added Sidewalk Labs’ proposal has never included a “surveillance system, social credit scores or facial recognition.” Canada is in the process of upgrading its digital privacy laws, which have not been updated since the 1990s.

167,2020-02-29 00:00:00,2020,2.0,29,Svea Herbst-Bayliss,"Elliott targets Twitter, seeking CEO Dorsey's removal: sources","(Reuters) - Hedge fund Elliott Management Corp has amassed a stake in Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and is pushing for changes, including removal of the social media company’s chief executive, Jack Dorsey, two people familiar with the matter said on Friday. Twitter is one of the few U.S. technology companies headed, but not controlled, by one of its founders. It has given shareholders equal voting rights, making Dorsey, who owns only about 2% of the company, vulnerable to a challenge from an activist investor such as Elliott. Twitter shares fell last year when the company disclosed that its platform experienced glitches that hindered its ability to target ads and share data with partners. The San Francisco-based company’s reluctance to expand beyond its core platform has also left it with limited scale compared to its larger social media peers. Elliott, founded by billionaire Paul Singer, will be seeking to install its own nominees to Twitter’s eight-member board when three of the company’s directors stand for election at its upcoming annual shareholder meeting, the sources said. It is not clear who Elliott would like Dorsey replaced with and how big its stake in Twitter is. The New York-based hedge fund has more than $40 billion in assets under management, and has targeted companies in recent months ranging from eBay Inc (EBAY.O) to SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T). The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Elliott declined to comment. Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bloomberg News first reported on Friday on Elliott’s position in Twitter. Dorsey, 43, is one of Silicon Valley’s most prominent entrepreneurs, and also runs Square Inc (SQ.N), a mobile payments company he co-founded. While investors have tolerated this arrangement since 2015, when Dorsey became Twitter’s CEO for the second time, his announcement in November that he would like to move to Africa for up to six months raised questions among analysts about his management. Dorsey, who helped conceive Twitter in 2006, first served as CEO until 2008, when he was replaced by one of his co-founders Ev Williams. Williams had accused Dorsey of being a poor manager and not focusing enough on Twitter’s profitability. Dorsey returned as interim CEO after his predecessor Dick Costolo stepped down. Dorsey’s knowledge of the company and quick launch of new products convinced Twitter’s board to hand him the reins on a permanent basis a few months later. Dorsey is not the first CEO to run two major companies. Steve Jobs led Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and animated movie studio Pixar for several years, while Elon Musk runs electric car pioneer Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O) and rocket maker SpaceX.

The bank and its two sister organizations plan to double their investments in climate action to about $200 billion from 2021-2025, with a boost in support for efforts to adapt to higher temperatures, wilder weather and rising seas. The latest figures on international climate funding for developing nations show barely a quarter has been going to adaptation, with the bulk backing clean energy adoption and more efficient energy use, aimed at cutting planet-warming emissions. “We live in a new normal in which disasters are more severe and more frequent,” World Bank CEO Kristalina Georgieva told the Thomson Reuters Foundation at U.N. climate talks in Poland. “We have to prioritize adaptation everywhere, but especially in the most vulnerable parts of the world,” she said, pointing to the Horn of Africa and the Sahel, coastal regions and small island states. Of the $100 billion the World Bank plans to make available in the five years from mid-2020, half would go to adaptation measures, it said. Those include building more robust homes, schools and infrastructure, preparing farmers for climate shifts, managing water wisely and protecting people’s incomes through social safety nets, Georgieva added. The World Bank said the money would also improve weather forecasts, and provide early warning and climate information services for 250 million people in 30 developing countries. “Climate change is an existential threat to the world’s poorest and most vulnerable. These new targets demonstrate how seriously we are taking this issue,” World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim said in a statement. From 2014-2018, the World Bank spent nearly $21 billion on adaptation, which accounted for just over 40 percent of the climate benefits generated by the institution’s funding overall. Former U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the bank’s pledge to use half its climate finance to find solutions to deal with changing weather patterns was “important”. “Climate change is already having a disastrous impact on people right around the world and we are nearing the point of no return,” said Ban. “So we must take bold action to adapt to the reality of the threat facing us all.” A recently launched Global Commission on Adaptation, which Ban chairs with Georgieva and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, aims to put political muscle behind efforts to keep people safer in a hotter world. The remaining $100 billion in promised World Bank Group funding will come from the International Finance Corporation (IFC), which works with the private sector, and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, as well as private capital the group raises. “There are literally trillions of dollars of opportunities for the private sector to invest in projects that will help save the planet,” said IFC chief Philippe Le Houérou. The IFC will identify opportunities, use tools to make investments less risky, and attract private-sector cash in areas including renewable energy, green buildings, clean transport in cities and urban waste management, he added. Marshall Islands President Hilda Heine said her low-lying Pacific island state was struggling with fiercer storms and increasing seawater flooding that is contaminating fresh water with salt. The new World Bank funds would “help to build resilience, make us safer, and improve lives”, she said. “Global action needs to accelerate before it is too late,” she added. The “Big Shift Global” coalition of aid agencies and climate justice campaigners said the World Bank Group’s new commitment signaled that developing countries should receive far more support to tackle climate change. But it overlooked “the desperate need to radically scale up financing for off-grid renewable energy” to help the poorest gain access to electricity, they added.

U.S. gold futures slipped 0.2% to $1,283.40 an ounce. “Gold price in yuan has risen fairly sharply since early May and Shanghai premiums are softening. That is probably taking the edge off demand and maybe inducing some people to offer (sell) gold,” said Nicholas Frappell, global general manager, ABC Bullion. The trade war between the world’s two leading economies escalated on Friday, with the United States hiking tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods after Trump said Beijing “broke the deal” by reneging on earlier commitments. China has vowed to retaliate, without giving details. The United States and China appeared at a deadlock over trade negotiations on Sunday as Washington demanded promises of concrete changes to Chinese law and Beijing said it would not swallow any “bitter fruit” that harmed its interests. The offshore Chinese yuan dropped to its lowest levels in more than four months at 6.904 to the dollar. It last stood down 0.8% at 6.898 per dollar. A weaker yuan makes gold expensive for buyers in China. “Markets are still living in some form of half-glass full optimism, but that is likely to erode with time as the reality of a full-blown trade war sinks in,” said Howie Lee, economist, OCBC Bank. “I expect demand for gold to gain traction in the coming weeks,” Lee added. While gold has managed to find support due to a risk-aversion mood among investors, prices have been stuck in a $15 dollar range over the past week despite the slump in global markets. Gold was also facing a barrier around $1,290 levels, restricting buying from traders who follow technical charts, analysts said. “Gold’s performance has been rather disappointing to both bulls and bears alike,” INTL FCStone analyst Edward Meir said in a note. Signals are mixed for spot gold, as it is stuck in a neutral range of $1,284-$1,291 per ounce, according to Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao. While holdings of SPDR Gold Trust, the world’s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, fell 0.9 percent on Friday, speculators raised their net-long position in gold in the week ended May 7. “Although there was not much propulsion this past week, we think the momentum (in gold) could build, especially if equity weakness remains deep and protracted,” Meir said. Silver was down 0.6% at $14.66 per ounce, while platinum fell 1.2% to $850.66. Palladium dropped 1.4% to $1,337.65.

Sunak has been meeting trade unions and industry associations, who have warned that mass lay-offs are imminent unless help can be found within days rather than weeks. As the coronavirus outbreak sweeps across the world, governments, companies and investors are grappling with the biggest public health crisis since the 1918 influenza pandemic. Sunak is now considering tax holidays for companies and reversing the pay-as-you-earn tax system to funnel directly cash to companies so they can keep paying staff, the Financial Times reported. “We are working at pace, urgently, to see what further support we can put in place, particularly around employment support, looking at some models elsewhere and looking at what model might work best for workers here today,” Sunak told lawmakers in parliament’s Treasury Committee on Wednesday. The 39-year-old has adopted “whatever it takes” as his refrain, borrowed from former European Central Bank President Mario Draghi whose use of the phrase helped to quell a debt crisis in the euro zone. In the five weeks since he became finance minister in a shock promotion, Sunak has announced a budget which included a 30 billion-pound stimulus plan and this week has launched 330 billion pounds ($380 billion) of loan guarantees for business. But these measures failed to restore confidence in the world’s fifth-biggest economy. The pound crashed to its lowest level against the dollar in 35 years on Wednesday and British government bond prices plunged as scores of companies, big and small, said they would need to cut jobs to survive. These factors spurred the Bank of England into cutting interest rates to 0.1% on Thursday and unleashing an extra 200 billion pounds of bond purchases. Asked on a BBC panel show what Sunak would announce on Friday, health minister Matt Hancock said: “All I can say is mark my words — we are going to do everything we can to keep people supported at times like this.” ($1 = 0.8679 pounds) (Reporting by Andy Bruce, editing by Estelle Shirbon)",https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-britain-sunak/uks-sunak-readies-extreme-measures-to-right-capsizing-economy-idUSL4N2BC5CN,Healthcare,Reuters

Democratic Republic of Congo is Africa’s top copper producer and the leading miner of cobalt, which is used for electric car batteries, but remains one of the world’s poorest countries. Congo’s state mining company said the first such production-sharing deal by Gecamines would guarantee it a “significant” share of annual production from processing facilities in the southeastern town of Kolwezi. Gecamines has said that its joint ventures with international miners like Glencore and China Molybdenum do not bring enough money into state coffers and is turning instead to a production-sharing agreements, which are common in the oil sector. “Production sharing agreements align the interests of the two partners because the risk now weighs more on the investor than on Gecamines,” Gecamines economic adviser Stephane Cormier said in a presentation. Gecamines chairman Albert Yuma added that a $40 million installment of Hong Kong Excellen’s signing bonus would be paid by the end of the year. Since its heyday in the 1980s, when it produced close to 500,000 tonnes of copper a year, Gecamines has fallen heavily into debt and last year produced less than 16,000 tonnes.

173,2018-08-26 00:00:00,2018,8.0,26,,Germany's public debt could fall below EU ceiling this year: Scholz,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany’s public sector debt could fall below the European Union’s debt ceiling before the end of the year, Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said on Sunday, after figures this week showed a booming economy was generating a record surplus. Speaking at the annual open day at which Berlin’s ministries open their doors to the public, Scholz said that Germany’s debt levels could fall below 60 percent of economic output earlier than the originally planned target of 2019. The plummeting debt levels are helped by the robust health of Europe’s largest economy, which grew 0.5 percent in the second quarter, driving the public sector surplus for the first half of the year to a record 48.1 billion euros ($55 billion). That towering surplus has drawn increasingly urgent calls from lobbyists and other governments for Germany to invest more, prompting even the ultra-cautious Scholz to concede that the shower of cash offered “further possibilities”. But on Sunday, Scholz reaffirmed Germany’s commitment to meeting the so-called Maastrict criteria, the public debt element of which has been breached by most participants since the 2008 financial crisis, implying that Germany’s debt could fall even further. “In 1990 debt was about 40 percent of social product,” he said, referring to the time immediately before West Germany took on the aging industries and weak currency of formerly Communist East Germany, seeking to overturn 40 years of relative decline with one of the biggest investment programs in history. The EU’s Maastricht Treaty requires member states to run a deficit of no more than 3 percent of gross domestic product each year. The 60 percent public debt threshold has been violated by many member states for years, with Germany last keeping under the threshold 17 years ago.

The driver of one of two truck bombs was killed when his vehicle exploded next to a petrol tanker at a busy junction in downtown Mogadishu. Hundreds of people died in the conflagration. The second vehicle, driven by Hasan Aden Isak, detonated after soldiers ordered the driver to get out of his vehicle at a checkpoint. It killed two people. “Hasan Aden Isak was sentenced to death and Abdullahi Hassan Absuge was sentenced to life imprisonment,” said the Somali military court chairman, Hassan Ali Nur, according to the Somali News Agency. Reporters were not permitted to cover the trial. The part played by Absuge, who was sentenced in absentia, in the attacks was not clear. The Oct. 14 bombing sparked angry street protests against al Shabaab, the al Qaeda-linked militant group that carries out most of the bombings in Somalia. Al Shabaab never claimed responsibility for the attack. The militant group wants to overthrow the weak, U.N.-backed government and impose strict Islamic law. It has steadily been losing territory since African Union peacekeepers arrived in Somalia a decade ago, but still carries out frequent bombings in the capital.

176,2018-02-05 00:00:00,2018,2.0,5,Emma Batha,'Heartwrenching' study shows FGM prevalent among India's Bohra sect,"LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Three quarters of women among India’s Dawoodi Bohra sect have undergone female genital mutilation (FGM), according to a study published on Monday which comes just weeks after government officials said there was no data to support its existence. Campaigners hope the survey - the largest of its kind - will bolster calls for a law to ban the secretive ritual which they say causes physical, emotional and sexual harm. One mother told how she feared her daughter would bleed to death after she was cut. A third of women believed the procedure had damaged their sex lives. Others spoke of emotional trauma. Traditional circumcisers told researchers they had cut thousands of girls. Masooma Ranalvi, founder of campaign group WeSpeakOut which commissioned the study, said the stories were “heartwrenching”. “This report not only proves FGM does exist in India, but also shows how harmful it is,” Ranalvi told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “Children are still being cut today. This must end.” The year-long study - published on the eve of International Day of Zero Tolerance for FGM - includes 94 interviews with supporters and opponents of the practice. The Dawoodi Bohra, a Shi’ite Muslim sect thought to number up to 2 million worldwide, considers the ritual, known as khafd, a religious obligation although it is not mentioned in the Koran. The procedure, which entails cutting the clitoral hood, is performed around the age of seven. India’s Supreme Court is considering a petition to ban FGM. Campaigners were shocked in December when the women’s ministry told the court there was no official data or study supporting its existence. FGM is more commonly linked to a swathe of African countries where cutters may remove all external genitalia. Supporters of khafd told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that the ritual was a “harmless” cultural and religious practice. The Dawoodi Bohra Women’s Association for Religious Freedom said the study did not represent the views of most Bohra women. A spokeswoman said in an email that khafd and FGM were “entirely different” practices, and that there was “no place for any kind of mutilation” in the Bohra culture. But the World Health Organization says FGM includes any injury to the genitalia. One gynaecologist told researchers it would be easy to damage the clitoris if a girl struggled during the procedure which is done without anaesthesia. Ranalvi said khafd was rooted in beliefs a woman’s sexual desire must be curbed, but it was “mired in secrecy” and few women dared speak out for fear of ostracisation. The practice made headlines in 2015 when three members of the Bohra diaspora in Australia were convicted of FGM-related offences. Bohras in the United States face similar charges. Respondents to the survey said Bohra girls from diaspora communities were now traveling to India to be cut.

177,2019-10-31 00:00:00,2019,10.0,31,,"CIA-backed Afghan units carry out illegal killings, other abuse: group","KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan security units backed by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) have carried out extrajudicial executions, enforced disappearances, indiscriminate air strikes and other rights abuses and should be disbanded, a rights group said on Thursday. Human Rights Watch said it investigated 14 cases in which CIA-backed Afghan counterinsurgency forces committed serious abuses in Afghanistan between late 2017 and mid-2019. “They are illustrative of a larger pattern of serious laws-of-war violations — some amounting to war crimes — that extends to all provinces in Afghanistan where these paramilitary forces operate with impunity,” the group said in a report. A CIA spokesman said the agency conducts its operations “in accordance with law and under a robust system of oversight”. “The Taliban does not operate with any similar rules and -even worse - conducts an extensive propaganda campaign to discredit those who support the legitimate Afghanistan government,” said the spokesman, Timothy Barrett. The Afghan government declined to comment until after publication of the report, but a military official acknowledged that the Afghan special units at times make mistakes. “Because they carry out the most complicated operations but we are not assassins and there is oversight and accountability,” said the official, who declined to be identified. The CIA-backed paramilitary forces are notorious in Afghanistan, often drawing complaints from villagers and district authorities for their brutal raids, often under the cover of night. But the rights group said the Afghan government lacked the capacity and the political will to investigate incidents involving the forces. The group cited a diplomat referring to them as “death squads”. While Afghan paramilitary forces nominally belong to the main National Directorate of Security (NDS) intelligence service, the CIA-backed forces do not fall under the agency’s normal chain of command, nor those of the Afghan or U.S. militaries. “They largely have been recruited, trained, equipped, and overseen by the CIA,” Human Rights Watch said. “They often have U.S. special forces personnel deployed alongside them during kill-or-capture operations; these U.S. forces, primarily Army Rangers, have been seconded to the CIA.” The forces have also been allowed to call in air strikes, which is likely a factor behind a rising toll of civilian casualties in the war. They have also attacked medical facilities and killed staff, the group said. Human Rights Watch said that in many of the raids it investigated, the Afghan forces seem to have unlawfully targeted civilians because of mistaken identity, poor intelligence or political rivalries. One case involved the killing of 11 men in the eastern province of Paktia in August. The NDS said at the time 11 militants were killed in a raid on a Taliban hideout but villagers and a politician in the area said the dead included students celebrating the Eid al-Adha Muslim holiday and other innocent civilians. “The strike forces might have targeted the wrong house, or operated on faulty intelligence, possibly fueled by local rivalries,” the rights group said. The government ordered an investigation but no findings have been released. While the United States and the Taliban have been discussing the withdrawal of U.S. troops, some U.S. officials have called for the clandestine Afghan forces to be maintained as a bulwark against al Qaeda and Islamic State militants. Human Rights Watch said the CIA-backed forces should be disbanded and allegations of abuses investigated.

181,2020-01-29 00:00:00,2020,1.0,29,Howard Schneider,"WRAPUP 1-Fed likely to keep interest rates on hold, focus on balance sheet","* Fed to release policy statement at 2 p.m. EST (1900 GMT) * Powell to hold news conference at 2:30 p.m. EST (1930 GMT) By Howard Schneider WASHINGTON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve will conclude its latest policy meeting on Wednesday with interest rates almost certainly to remain on hold but officials likely to discuss possible changes to how they manage the U.S. central bank’s key overnight borrowing rate. Since the Fed cut rates in October, its third and final reduction in borrowing costs in 2019, policymakers have agreed to keep their target policy rate in the current range of 1.50% and 1.75% until there is some significant change in the economic outlook. U.S. data since the Fed’s last policy meeting in December have done little to shift expectations for continued economic growth this year of around 2% and steady, low unemployment. Some risks may have risen - with China’s economic growth now in the spotlight after a coronavirus outbreak - and U.S. Treasury bond yields have fallen as a result. U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday also repeated his call for even lower rates. The Republican president lambasted the Fed and its chief, Jerome Powell, in 2018 and 2019 for maintaining a monetary policy that he regarded as too tight. While investors have increased bets the Fed would cut rates again at some point this year, analysts still were near unanimous that any such decision is months down the road. Ninety-five of 108 economists polled by Reuters recently said they expected the Fed to leave rates on hold at this week’s meeting, and JP Morgan analyst Michael Feroli said it would likely be “one of the least eventful meetings in recent years.” The Fed is due to release its policy statement at 2 p.m. EST (1900 GMT). Powell is scheduled to hold a news conference half an hour later. LONG-TERM FIX The current solid consensus over rates, however, doesn’t mean the agenda is empty. The Fed is expected to soon decide how much longer it will continue its current practice of buying $60 billion a month in U.S. Treasury bonds, how to scale that program back, and what will replace it as a long-term fix for its management of short-term bank funding markets. Pumping that extra liquidity into the banking system each month has allowed the Fed to keep short-term interest rates within the target range, addressing an issue that arose last fall when a shortage of bank reserves led that rate to spike. But it is considered less than an ideal fix. It means the Fed each month is adding to its roughly $4 trillion in assets. Some policymakers would prefer the central bank have a smaller balance sheet if possible. It has also created the impression that the Fed is engaging in a scaled-down form of the “quantitative easing” it used to prop up the economy in response to the 2007-2009 recession. Fed officials argue against that comparison, but they face the issue of how to scale the monthly purchases back without risking fallout in asset markets where the extra central bank liquidity is considered a “tailwind” that helps lift prices. “The question is when, not if,” the balance sheet growth stops, Cornerstone Macro analyst Roberto Perli wrote. “We expect Powell to convey this message but to stay vague on timing, for now.” As they discuss how to end this current round of asset purchases, Fed officials are also debating what could take its place. Some policymakers support a permanent offering of short-term “repo” loans that banks could tap as needed, a system they say would allow reserve levels to be set by banks. In a related adjustment, the Fed may also raise by perhaps five basis points the interest rate it pays banks on excess reserves as a way to keep the federal funds rate closer to the middle of the current policy target rate.

182,2019-06-07 00:00:00,2019,6.0,7,,"May steps down as party chief, igniting leadership race","LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May stepped down as leader of the governing Conservatives on Friday, officially triggering a contest to replace her that could see her party embrace a tougher stance on Brexit.  May announced she would step down last month after failing to deliver Britain’s departure from the European Union on time, deepening a political crisis in a divided country struggling to move on from a 2016 referendum on Brexit.  She will continue to work as prime minister until her party elects a new leader, a crowded race that will be defined by Brexit and competing approaches on how to deliver Britain’s biggest foreign policy shift in more than 40 years.  “For the remainder of her time in office, she will be building on the domestic agenda that she has put at the heart of her premiership,” her spokeswoman told reporters.  May exchanged letters with the leaders of the influential 1922 Committee of Conservative lawmakers, according to a statement from the committee.  May, once a reluctant supporter of EU membership who emerged from the chaos after the 2016 referendum as prime minister, steps down with her central pledge - to lead Britain out of the bloc and heal the country’s divisions - unfulfilled.  Her team has been keen to shape her legacy beyond the Brexit failure, but she bequeaths to her successor a nation where traditional political divides are being eroded by strong beliefs on whether Britain should leave the EU, and how it should do so.  The contest to replace her has been heating up for weeks, with candidates arguing over the rights and wrongs of a so-called no-deal Brexit, or leaving the EU without a deal.   Official nominations will be received on Monday. The selection process should be completed by the end of July.   Former foreign minister Boris Johnson is the favourite to win. He champions a tougher stance on Brexit, saying Britain should leave with or without a deal by the new deadline of Oct. 31. He is seeking to persuade Conservatives that he is the only candidate who could win a new national election for the Conservative Party.  Other leading contenders include the current foreign minister, Jeremy Hunt, and environment minister Michael Gove, who take a less hardline stance on Brexit.  But Michel Barnier, the EU’s Brexit negotiator, said on Friday any new prime minister will still face the problem of what to do with the Irish border, in order to secure frictionless trade, after Britain leaves the bloc.

Here is a timeline of the case and its geopolitical implications. AUG. 22, 2018: A New York court issues an arrest warrant for Meng, so that she could be detained to stand trial in the United States. NOV. 29, 2018: The United States learns that Meng will be passing through Vancouver International Airport on her way to Mexico. DEC. 1, 2018: Meng is arrested by Canadian police in Vancouver as she changes planes. The arrest is not made public until Dec. 5. The Chinese embassy in Canada demands her release. DEC. 6, 2018: Chinese officials say they have not been given a reason for Meng’s arrest. The White House and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau both move to distance themselves from the arrest. DEC. 7, 2018: Court proceedings show that the United States issued the arrest warrant because it believes Meng covered up attempts by Huawei-linked companies to sell equipment to Iran, breaking U.S. sanctions against the country. DEC. 8, 2018: China says the arrest of Meng was “extremely nasty” and threatens Canada with consequences if it does not release her. DEC. 10, 2018: Two Canadians are detained in China - a former Canadian diplomat, Michael Kovrig, and businessman Michael Spavor. China denies their arrests are related to Meng’s case. The arrests are made public on Dec. 11 and Dec. 12. DEC. 11, 2018: Meng is released on bail by a British Columbian court. U.S. President Donald Trump says he will intervene in the case if it would serve national interests.

JAN. 22, 2019: The U.S. Justice Department announces it will formally seek the extradition of Meng to the United States. JAN. 23, 2019: John McCallum, Canada’s ambassador to China, tells Chinese-language media that Huawei can make a good case against extradition, thanks in part to Trump’s comments about his willingness to get involved. JAN. 26, 2019: Trudeau fires McCallum after his comments to the press, marking the first time a Canadian ambassador had ever been fired. FEB. 4, 2019: Canadian canola shipments are delayed in clearing Chinese customs, slowing trade to one of Canada’s biggest exporters. MARCH 1, 2019: Canada approves the extradition order of Meng to the United States. MARCH 3, 2019: Huawei sues the Canadian government over Meng’s arrest. China claims detained Canadian Michael Kovrig stole state secrets. MARCH 6, 2019: China says it found “hazardous pests” in Canadian canola samples and blocks most shipments of the crop. APRIL 29, 2019: Canadian farm exports across the board hit obstacles at Chinese ports. MAY 1, 2019: China blocks shipments entirely from two Canadian pork producers.

Trudeau moved long-serving Agriculture Minister Lawrence MacAulay to the veterans affairs portfolio to replace Jody Wilson-Raybould, who quit on Feb. 12 after less than a month in the job. Wilson-Raybould testified on Wednesday that when she was justice minister last year, officials in the Liberal government leaned on her to help construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoid a corruption trial. Her remarks prompted the leader of the official opposition Conservative Party to demand Trudeau’s resignation. Polls show the affair is starting to hurt the Liberals ahead of a federal election set for this October. Trudeau, who denies there was any wrongdoing, broke with tradition and did not take questions from reporters after the shuffle, which saw International Development Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau replace MacAulay at agriculture. Women’s Minister Maryam Monsef took on the international development portfolio in addition to her current job.

187,2018-01-10 00:00:00,2018,1.0,10,,Algeria sends more oil to Cuba as Venezuelan supplies fall,"ALGIERS (Reuters) - Algeria sent 2.1 million barrels of crude oil to Cuba last year and will ship the same amount in 2018, an official at state energy firm Sonatrach said on Wednesday, helping Cuba to offset lower supplies from the island’s closest ally, Venezuela. “We delivered in 2017 three times 700,000 barrels, a total of 2.1 million barrels to Cuba,” Omar Maaliou, Sonatrach’s vice president in charge of trade and marketing, told Reuters. “We will do the same this year, the first 700,000 barrels are about to be delivered.” Saharan Blend light sweet crude is Algeria’s main export grade. Cuba and Algeria have maintained a close relationship in recent years. The island annually imports some $200 million to$300 million of oil products from the African country, including some purchases of naphtha. Cuba is also a regular buyer of Algerian jet fuel. But Cuba has relied almost exclusively on Venezuela, also an OPEC member, for its crude supplies through a 15-year-old assistance program that Caracas has been struggling to maintain as power cuts, lack of investment and payment delays slash its oil output. Insufficient crude imports last year – mainly from Venezuela - forced Cuba’s state-run oil company Cupet to cut operations at its 65,000-barrel-per-day Cienfuegos refinery, where Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA had a 49-percent stake until August. It only refined 24,000 bpd of crude last year, according to official numbers. Along with the drop in volume, the quality of the crude PDVSA had available for export also changed to heavier grades than Cuba’s refinery was used to. Cuba bought the light Algerian crude for the first time in 2016 to blend with the heavier oil. PDVSA had previously supplied Cuba with a few cargoes of other light foreign crude grades. Cuba has also been buying oil products from Russia’s Rosneft, which recently started talks with the Cuban government on exploring partnerships there.

The Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations released the 105-page report saying China started in the late 1990s to exchange salaries, research funding, laboratory space and other incentives for information from U.S. university laboratories and other research institutions, much of it publicly funded. As China spent 20 years recruiting researchers with access to advanced science and technology, U.S. agencies failed to adequately respond. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, for example, did not respond strongly until mid-2018, the report said. Amid rising tensions between the United States and China over issues including trade and Chinese expansion in the South China Sea, Washington has been confronting Beijing over what it sees as the use of sometimes illicit methods for acquiring rapid technological advances. In one example, the Senate investigators said, a post-doctoral researcher who was part of China’s “Thousand Talents Plan” removed more than 30,000 electronic files, including presentations, technical papers, research and charts from a laboratory before returning to China. Asked for comment, an FBI spokeswoman noted that one if its top officials would testify at a public Senate hearing on the report on Tuesday. Officials from the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, Department of Energy and State Department, all scrutinized as part of the investigation, are also testifying. The Chinese government has repeatedly insisted Washington has exaggerated the problem for political reasons, dismissing espionage allegations as groundless. Senators Rob Portman, the Republican subcommittee chairman, and Tom Carper, its top Democrat, said they would use the report to write legislation to end “this abuse” of U.S. research, intelligence property and taxpayer money. “These talent plans are a win-win for China. China wins twice. First, the American taxpayer funds China’s research and development. Second, China uses that research to improve its economic and military status,” Portman said in a statement. The report said China had originally hoped to find 2,000 people for its Thousand Talents Plan and other such programs, but it had recruited more than 7,000 by 2017. Portman and Carper released the report amid discussions between the United States and China aimed at coming to an initial agreement to resolve a trade war that has lasted for more than a year.

189,2019-07-11 00:00:00,2019,7.0,11,Sonia Elks,Britain urged to reform 'failing' energy policy to meet net zero goal,"LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Britain must urgently reform its “failing” national policy on energy efficiency to have any prospect of meeting an ambitious target to slash its carbon emissions to net zero by 2050, parliamentarians said on Friday. The state should invest more in energy efficiency, designate it a national infrastructure priority and tighten rules to force builders to improve standards in homes and offices, said the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) Committee. “Improving energy efficiency is by far the cheapest way of cutting our emissions and must be a key plank of any credible strategy to deliver net zero by 2050,” said the parliamentary committee’s chairwoman Rachel Reeves in a statement. “If the government lacks the political will to deliver energy efficiency improvements, how can we expect it to get on with the costlier actions needed to tackle climate change?” Britain last month became the first G7 country to adopt an ambitious law to reach net zero emissions by 2050. However, it has failed to set sufficient policies to combat climate change and must act urgently to cut greenhouse gas emissions to meet the new net zero target, the advisory Committee on Climate Change warned earlier this week. Energy used to heat buildings creates nearly 20% of Britain’s emissions, most of which comes from residential homes, Friday’s BEIS Committee report said. “The government is presiding over a failing policy,” it said, pointing to shrinking investment in energy efficiency and builders exploiting legal loopholes to avoid meeting efficiency standards. Robert Gross, director of the Centre for Energy Policy and Technology at Imperial College London, one of Europe’s most innovative universities for science, said the report echoed the views of many energy experts. “Progress with energy efficiency has stalled and needs a policy kickstart,” he said. “We cannot do everything we need to with efficiency but it’s where we should start. It’s often low cost and can be a prerequisite for other technologies to work.” The Confederation of British Industry, which represents 190,000 businesses, urged the government to accept the recommendation that it make energy efficiency a national infrastructure priority. “UK business stands squarely behind the government’s commitment to achieve net zero emissions by 2050,” said Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI’s chief economist. “A cross-departmental approach, working jointly with business, will improve the efficiency of our homes and buildings and develop the skills and funding needed to make them fit for the future.” Reporting by Sonia Elks @soniaelks; Editing by Katy Migiro.

The European Central Bank said last month it would likely stop its stimulus program at the end of this year and may raise rates in the autumn of 2019. “A scenario where interest rates increase, for example due to increased risk premia... could put debt sustainability and, as a consequence, financial stability at risk,” the European Systemic Risk Board said in its annual report. The ESRB, chaired by the ECB President Mario Draghi, upgraded its assessment of the severity of this risk to “medium”. Investors have so far taken a benign view of the gradual policy tightening mapped out by the ECB, with the 10-year benchmark interest rate for the euro area - a gauge of borrowing costs based on German bond yields - at a paltry 0.30 percent on expectations of continued support from the central bank. But they have been demanding a bigger premium to hold Italian debt over its German counterpart since an anti-establishment government took power in Rome with a promise cut taxes and spend more. The ESRB said a reversal in financial markets remained the only “high risk” facing the EU, and it downgraded risks relating to weak balance sheets in the financial sector to “medium”. The ESRB identifies three categories for financial vulnerabilities over up to three years: risk, medium risk and high risk.

Europe will enter into a recession and this will drag the overall European economy into negative growth rates in the year, but in the second semester I believe we will see positive growth rates for Europe,” he added. De Guindos insisted that the ECB will act as much as needed to combat the coronavirus’ damaging economic impact and stressed the importance of avoiding a debt crisis in Europe. With Europe’s economy badly hurt by the outbreak amid intense market volatility, the ECB has agreed to a range of stimulus measures including ultra-cheap loans to banks and asset buys worth 1.1 trillion euros this year with the goal of keeping low borrowing costs for firms and governments. The ECB’s vice president also said it would be very important for Europe to issue pan-European bonds as some countries such as Spain are requesting.

The proposed amendments to Canada’s Criminal Code include offenses such as causing a person to undergo conversion therapy, advertising and profiting from conversion therapy and removing a minor from Canada. Conversion therapy is any practice designed to change a person’s sexual orientation to heterosexual, gender identity to one that matches the sex assigned at birth, or to repress or reduce non-heterosexual sexual attraction or behaviors, according to the legislation. The bill also amends the Criminal Code to authorize courts to order disposing of or deleting advertisements for conversion therapy. “Conversion therapy has been discredited and denounced by professionals and health associations in Canada, the United States and around the world. It has no basis on science or facts,” said Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada David Lametti. The legislation would not criminalize personal views expressed in private conversations by individuals looking to provide support to those struggling with their sexual orientation or gender identity. The bill was introduced by Lametti and Bardish Chagger, minister of Diversity and Inclusion and Youth. Conversion therapy has been banned in some Canadian cities such as Vancouver and Calgary. Ontario was the first Canadian province to ban the practice in 2015. Several U.S. states, including California, Colorado, New York and Washington, have banned conversion therapy.

The pair were among 12 plaintiffs in a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) challenging changes in asylum policies ordered by U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Washington D.C. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan was hearing a request to stay the plaintiffs’ deportations, when the ACLU learned that two of them were already on a flight to Central America, the civil rights group said. Upon hearing the news, Sullivan ordered their flight returned and suggested that Sessions could be held in contempt of court, according to the ACLU. An official from the Department of Homeland Security said in an emailed statement that the agency is “complying with the court’s order, and upon arrival in El Salvador, the plaintiffs did not disembark and are currently en route back to the United States.” During the hearing, the judge ordered a temporary stay on deporting the nine women and three children who filed the lawsuit, according to a court filing. The lawsuit was filed on Tuesday in the District of Columbia by the ACLU. It challenges a recent tightening on standards for seeking U.S. asylum, which makes it far more difficult for those fleeing domestic or gang violence to win the right to remain in the United States. Sessions has led efforts by the Trump Administration to crack down on illegal immigration, including the adoption of a zero tolerance policy that briefly included separating immigrant parents from their children while they were in U.S. detention. The family separation policy led to widespread criticism and was abandoned in June.

In a five-page letter from Kinder Morgan Canada’s President Ian Anderson to British Columbia Premier John Horgan, sent on Tuesday and seen by Reuters on Thursday, Anderson questioned the province’s objectives and said the new rules were in conflict with review processes already completed. “To that end we have initiated a technical and legal review of whether the suggested provincial initiatives could apply lawfully to a federally regulated Project,” he wrote. It is the company’s first detailed response since British Columbia’s left-leaning New Democrats announced the proposed new rules last week. The actual regulatory language will be made clear in an intentions paper due later this month. The plan has prompted a trade battle with Alberta, which retaliated on Tuesday by halting imports of B.C. wine, and has called for the Canadian government to step in. The C$7.4 billion ($5.88 billion) project was approved by Canada in 2016. Canadian Environment Minister Catherine McKenna said on Thursday that she had told her provincial counterparts that Ottawa backs the project and has ultimate jurisdiction over it. If built, the expansion will nearly triple capacity on the existing Trans Mountain pipeline to 890,000 barrels per day. The line extends from Alberta’s energy heartland to a port in Metro Vancouver. It is championed by Canada’s energy producers, whose oil trades at deep discounts to the West Texas Intermediate crude benchmark, but is opposed by environmentalists, along with some Aboriginal communities and local municipalities, who fear the impact of a potential oil spill. In his letter, Kinder Morgan’s Anderson outlined the various studies and measures already undertaken on oil spill response. Anderson also invited Horgan to meet with him to review the company’s plans, and noted any new rules should build on existing work by experts on spill response. “If your review proceeds, as suggested, ... it should be used to broaden understanding and learning, not as a tool to frustrate or delay our Project and investment generally in the energy sector in Canada,” he wrote. Horgan’s office said they were working on a response.

But even during the signing ceremony for a trade deal with China that promises to clear up some of that uncertainty, President Donald Trump reprised a long-running gripe against the Federal Reserve, and appeared to identify a possible new Fed chair who might fix the problem. “I could have used you a little bit here,” Trump said to former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, who made no secret in Trump’s first year in office that he wanted the Fed chair job. Trump picked Jerome Powell instead, a move he has since said he regretted. “Why weren’t you more forceful when you wanted that job? ... I would have been very happy with you. But Kevin, thank you for being here. You understand that very well, right?” From there, Trump launched for the first time in about a month into what has been a recurrent complaint against the Powell Fed. “We’re the number one [economy] in the world by far, and we have to pay for our money,” Trump said, contrasting U.S. borrowing costs with Europe’s negative interest rates, a function of that region’s slower growth and dimmer outlook. “Our interest rates are set high by the Fed. Our dollar’s very high.” That is not the way Fed policymakers see it. Last year, with Trump waging a trade war with China and other countries, and Europe slowing, the U.S. central bank cut rates three times to a target range of 1.5% to 1.75%, a level it expects to stick to for the time being. Rates are currently in a “good place,” unless there is a substantial change in inflation, Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said on Wednesday in New York, adding that low rates can encourage excessive risk-taking. Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan, speaking at a separate event in New York, voiced renewed skepticism that negative rates can help economic growth and said he expects the U.S. economy to grow at about 2% this year, slower than last year but still fast enough to push down on unemployment in his view. “My expectation is inflation will gradually go back up to target and reach a sustainable 2% in 2021,” San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said at the Bishop Ranch Executive Forum in San Ramon, about an hour’s drive from her bank’s headquarters. She too said the economy will grow at about 2%, keeping unemployment at its current 3.5% level and pushing up wages by between 3% and 3.5%. “If it went up a little bit more, that would only get us to our inflation target a little bit faster,” Daly said. The three policymakers spoke on the same day Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He signed an initial trade deal at the White House after 18 months of tit-for-tat tariffs between the world’s two largest economies that has uprooted supply chains and slowed global growth. A survey conducted by the Fed in late 2019 and released on Wednesday showed that uncertainty over U.S. trade policy continued to hurt firms, even as the U.S. economy expanded at a modest pace. “In many districts, tariffs and trade uncertainty continued to weigh on some businesses,” the Fed said in its report, compiled from questionnaires and interviews with business contacts across the country. Powell’s term as Fed chair runs to 2022, a term he expects to complete despite searing criticism from Trump. Americans choose their next president at elections in November, and if Trump keeps his job as president he has made it clear he would replace Powell. Warsh was a Fed policymaker for five years until 2011, when he resigned in the wake of the Fed’s decision to launch its second round of bond-buying, a move Warsh worried would exacerbate what he viewed as already overly accommodative monetary policy.

199,2020-03-09 00:00:00,2020,3.0,9,Martin Pollard,"Even mask-wearers can be ID'd, China facial recognition firm says","BEIJING (Reuters) - A Chinese company says it has developed the country’s first facial recognition technology that can identify people when they are wearing a mask, as most are these days because of the coronavirus, and help in the fight against the disease. China employs some of the world’s most sophisticated systems of electronic surveillance, including facial recognition. But the coronavirus, which emerged in Hubei province late last year, has resulted in almost everyone wearing a surgical mask outdoors in the hope of warding off the virus - posing a particular problem for surveillance. Now Hanwang Technology Ltd, which also goes by the English name Hanvon, said it has come up technology that can successfully recognize people even when they are wearing masks. “If connected to a temperature sensor, it can measure body temperature while identifying the person’s name, and then the system would process the result, say, if it detects a temperature over 38 degrees,” Hanwang Vice President Huang Lei told Reuters in an interview. The Beijing-based firm said a team of 20 staff used core technology developed over the past 10 years, a sample database of about 6 million unmasked faces and a much smaller database of masked faces, to develop the technology, The team began work on the system in January, as the coronavirus outbreak gathered pace, and began rolling it out to the market after just a month. It sells two main types of products that use the technology. One performs “single channel” recognition that is best used at, for example, entrances to office buildings. The other, more powerful, product is a “multi-channel” recognition system that uses “multiple surveillance cameras”. It can identify everyone in a crowd of up to 30 people “within a second”, Huang says. “When wearing a mask, the recognition rate can reach about 95%, which can ensure that most people can be identified,” Huang said, adding the success rate for people without mask is about 99.5%. A big customer, not surprisingly, is the Ministry of Public Security, which runs the police. Using Hanwang’s technology, the ministry can cross-reference images with its own database of names and other information and then identify and track people as they move about, Huang said. “It can detect crime suspects, terrorists or make reports or warnings,” he said. But the system struggles to identify people with both a mask and sunglasses, he said. “In this situation, all of the key facial information is lost. In such cases recognition is tough,” Huang said. The company has about 200 clients in Beijing using the technology, including the police, and expect scores more across 20 provinces to start installing it soon, Huang said. It is not immediately clear how Chinese citizens are reacting to this new technology. When it comes to other surveillance tools being used in the fight against the coronavirus, there has been some grumbling on social media but most people seem to be accepting extra intrusion, or even embracing it, as a means to deal with the health emergency. Although domestic customers have been driving Hanwang’s business, Huang also said he expected more foreign interest, as the virus spreads around the world and more people wear face masks. “It not only benefits Chinese people, but also, when the technology is applied globally, it can benefit the world,” he said.
