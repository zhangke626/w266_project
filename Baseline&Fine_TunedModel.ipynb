is subpoenaed \\u2014 in the Senate's impeachment trial of President Donald Trump. Bolton issued a statement Monday after the courts did not rule whether he would be compelled to testify during the House's impeachment proceedings, saying he was trying to meet his \\\"obligations both as a citizen and as former national security adviser.\\\" \\\"Accordingly, since my testimony is once again at issue, I have had to resolve the serious competing issues as best I could, based on careful consideration and study,\\\" Bolton said. \\\"I have concluded that, if the Senate issues a subpoena for my testimony, I am prepared to testify.\\\" Bolton is potentially a crucial witness, as he had firsthand knowledge of many of the events that formed the House's impeachment of the President over his dealings with Ukraine. The House sought his testimony but ultimately never subpoenaed Bolton, and Democrats withdrew their subpoena for his former deputy after it was challenged in court, as Democrats wanted to move forward with their impeachment probe and not wait for the court's decision. Bolton's statement is likely to put new pressures from Democrats on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to allow witnesses in the Senate trial, which Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and Democratic House leaders have pushed for. \\\"It is now up to four Senate Republicans to support bringing in Mr. Bolton, and the other three witnesses, as well as the key documents we have requested to ensure all the evidence is presented at the onset of a Senate trial,\\\" Schumer said in a statement. \\\"Given that Mr. Bolton's lawyers have stated he has new relevant information to share, if any Senate Republican opposes issuing subpoenas to the four witnesses and documents we have requested they would make absolutely clear they are participating in a cover up.\\\" But Bolton's statement is unlikely to change McConnell's strategy over Trump's impeachment trial, according to multiple GOP sources familiar with the matter. McConnell has rejected Democratic demands to require that the ground rules of the trial include testimony of Bolton and three other witnesses, along with documents withheld by the White House. He says such decisions about witnesses and documents should be made after opening arguments, though Democrats fear that's an attempt to prevent any witnesses from testifying at all. Several GOP sources familiar with the matter say that Bolton's Monday announcement will not sway McConnell. \\\"Not at all,\\\" one source said. McConnell plans to reiterate his view to Senate Republicans during a closed-door lunch on Tuesday, a source said.  Ultimately, issuing a subpoena for Bolton would require 51 votes in the Senate, meaning at least four Republicans would have to join 47 Democrats. Schumer said on the Senate floor Monday that Democrats would force senators to vote on the witnesses they were seeking, including Bolton. Bolton left a message with McConnell before he put out the statement to give him a heads up that it was coming, according to a source familiar with the matter. The White House was not informed. Impasse over impeachment articles continues Amid the Senate's impasse, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has yet to formally send the two impeachment articles to the Senate after the House passed them last month. Until the House formally sends the articles, McConnell has said the trial will not start. But he's dismissed the idea that Democrats can enact any concessions by withholding the articles. Pelosi had no advanced knowledge of Bolton's statement, but a senior Democratic aide said Pelosi's decision to withhold the articles played a role. \\\"We would not have this development absent the speaker's hold,\\\" the senior Democratic aide said. \\\"Another proof point that indicates the value of her strategy.\\\" Pelosi tweeted Monday that Trump and McConnell \\\"have run out of excuses.\\\"  \\\"They must allow key witnesses to testify, and produce the documents Trump has blocked, so Americans can see the facts for themselves,\\\" she said. \\\"The Senate cannot be complicit in the President's cover-up.\\\" Lawmakers return to Washington this week to resume the impeachment fight that's largely in the same position it was before Congress left town for the holidays. The major developments with Iran have added a new wrinkle to the battle between congressional Democrats and the White House, but it's unlikely to shift the calculus on the impeachment trial.  Even as Congress balances two of its most profound powers  \\u2014 authorizing war and impeaching a president \\u2014 the looming Iowa caucuses also create a remarkable convergence heading into Trump's fourth year in office. It's an unlikely trio of distinct events \\u2014 Iran, impeachment and Iowa \\u2014 now inexplicably linked in a deeply divided capital and country. While Democratic candidates vying for the right to challenge Trump were already bracing to be overshadowed by impeachment in January, their primary fight could now be influenced by the party's divisions on foreign policy. Bolton looms over Senate Speaking on the Senate floor Monday, McConnell did not address Bolton's new statement but reiterated that he believes witnesses should be dealt with later in the trial. The Republican leader accused Pelosi and Democrats of playing \\\"political games\\\" with impeachment by withholding the articles. \\\"Speaker Pelosi is now sitting on the articles she claimed were so very urgent. She's delayed this indefinitely so that the architects of the failed House process can look for ways to reach over here into the Senate and dictate our process as well,\\\" McConnell said. \\\"These bizarre stunts do not serve our Constitution or our national security. They erode both.\\\" Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, one of the Republican senators Democrats are eying to break ranks from McConnell on witnesses, told CNN on Monday \\\"of course\\\" he would like to hear from Bolton. \\\"I'd like to hear what he has to say,\\\" Romney said. Asked if he would vote to subpoena Bolton, however, Romney stopped short and said he first would want to know what the process is. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, another key GOP voice in the impeachment trial, said Monday that she views the trial in three stages -- presentations, then senator questions and then discussion over whether to have witnesses -- which lines up with McConnell's proposal. Collins said she's interested in hearing from Bolton in the third stage but showed no inclination to push to bring him in before that point. \\\"It's very difficult to decide that until we go through the first two stages,\\\" she said. Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican in Senate leadership, initially told reporters he \\\"has no objection\\\" to Bolton testifying \\\"by deposition or some pre-recorded testimony,\\\" but he later indicated he would not vote to subpoena him and warned against a \\\"circus-like atmosphere\\\" like the one he believes took place in the House.   He repeatedly said that he thought Bolton's testimony would be stifled by executive privilege that he said would likely be invoked by Trump on much of what Bolton would have to say.  \\\"He can't really waive executive privilege \\u2014 it's not his to privilege, it's the President's privilege,\\\" Cornyn said. And Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the Senate's No. 2 Republican, rejected the calls for the Senate to subpoena Bolton, arguing that's a step the House should have taken during the impeachment inquiry. \\\"If it was supposed to be, I think they would have done it in the House,\\\" Thune said. \\\"To me, they could have subpoenaed him. They didn't.\\\"  Bolton's testimony was sought in the House by Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, during the House's impeachment investigation into Trump's dealings with Ukraine. But Bolton's former deputy, Charles Kupperman, who has the same lawyer as Bolton, filed a lawsuit after he was subpoenaed, arguing the White House was directing him not to testify and the courts should decide the issue. Instead, the House withdrew its subpoena of Kupperman and did not issue a subpoena for Bolton after his attorney indicated he would go the same route. Bolton is one of several witnesses that House Democrats sought whom Senate Democrats are now pushing for in the Senate trial, including acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and White House aide Rob Blair. The new statement comes after Bolton was both surprised and curious that he had not been subpoenaed by the House, according to the source familiar with the matter. There had been mounting criticism that he wanted to hold off on sharing what he knew about the withholding of aid to Ukraine for his book. It is unclear what specifically triggered him to put out this statement right now. It is unclear what Bolton will do if the White House tries to block his testimony, or parts of it, the source said. But the statement speaks for itself in that he is prepared to provide testimony. This story has been updated with additional developments Monday.

(CNN)One of my good friends and one of the kindest human beings I have ever met worked to make me a second-class citizen. Matthew Dowd was President George W. Bush's chief strategist during the 2004 presidential election, an election cycle that saw the leader of the free world endorse a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, thus weaponizing bigotry to get re-elected.  Watching your dignity and civil rights be diminished into a Sunday morning talking point was humiliating, and when I met Dowd years later, being in the presence of a man who contributed to this humiliation initially filled me with anger. But then I chose not to submit to that anger. And because of that, I gained a friend.  More importantly I kept my power. Ellen DeGeneres, who is under fire from some for sitting next to and sharing laughs with President Bush during the Dallas Cowboys-Green Bay Packers game last Sunday, knows very well what it is like to be targeted for being LGBTQ. Undoubtedly, she remembers the humiliation and fear of 2004. She also remembers the pain of losing her career, arguably for being gay, after her sitcom, \\\"Ellen,\\\" was cancelled in 1998.  This strikes a particularly strong chord for me because I too came out in 1998. I too remember all that I lost in doing so. And like her, I too have shared laughs with some of the very people who contributed to the vilification of my community many years later. Not because we are sell-outs. Not because we have forgotten. But because anger cannot be the sole fuel propelling us on life's journey. We also need love, for without it, we are no better than those who fear us.  To live with anger is to live powerless. That's not to say the oppressed should never be angered by the actions of their oppressor. Only that anger can spark a movement but it should not order its steps. Not if the goal of the movement is peace.  To those who believe DeGeneres' actions were some sort of betrayal, I ask what significant civil rights movement occurred without support from those on the \\\"other side?\\\" Would women have gained the right to vote without men in Congress supporting the 19th Amendment? Of course not. Tweets can inform, protests garner attention, but changing hearts and minds requires genuine human interaction. Like the kind captured in a photograph in which DeGeneres and Bush dared to sit next to each other and share a laugh.  The two may still be on opposite sides when it comes to LGBTQ issues or any one of the litany of issues Bush decided as President during his eight years in the White House. They may be on the same side in terms of enjoying their status as one-percenters. Who knows? But clearly, they found common ground in treating each other with respect.  And for the life of me, I can see no harm in that.  Besides, as former Congressman Barney Frank likes to say, \\\"if you're not at the table, you're on the menu.\\\" Where some saw a sell-out in Ellen DeGeneres last Sunday, I saw a woman who once lost everything as an appetizer and who fought and clawed her way back to owning the restaurant.   So yes, be angry for what Bush, Dowd -- who has since apologized -- and others did 15 years ago. Be angry for what the Trump administration is doing now. But do not allow that anger to be so consuming that you hand your joy over to people who wish to bathe in your tears. They don't deserve to have that much power. \",\n          \"A bipartisan deal in Congress offers a glimmer of stability for the Obamacare insurance markets. But for it to become law, each party will need to declare a victory \\u2014 and President Donald Trump will have to agree to prop up a law he just spent months trying to repeal. For Democrats, the deal negotiated by Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.) would restore key subsidies that Trump cut off just days ago. For Republicans, it would offer states flexibility to approve health insurance plans that would have the lower premiums they\\u2019ve promised voters. The framework, which got immediate support from more Democrats than Republicans, will need the lobbying muscle of the White House to win over skeptical Republicans in Congress. The president\\u2019s initial supportive statements in the Rose Garden and in phone calls to Alexander \\u201care helpful because we need his support,\\u201d Alexander told reporters. \\u201cHis recognizing that, in his words, he doesn\\u2019t want people to be hurt over the next two years while we\\u2019re still debating the long-term consequences of health care, that\\u2019s very helpful.\\u201d Trump on Tuesday \\u2014 despite having abruptly axed the Obamacare cost-sharing subsidies on Oct. 12 and repeatedly declared Obamacare \\\"dead\\\" \\u2014 praised the idea of Congress restoring the payments as \\u201ca very good solution.\\u201d The president called it a \\u201cshort-term solution so that we don't have this very dangerous little period \\u2014 including dangerous periods for insurance companies, by the way.\\u201d But late on Tuesday in an appearance at The Heritage Foundation, Trump further muddied his position. \\u201cWhile I commend the bipartisan work done by Sens. Alexander and Murray \\u2014 and I do commend it \\u2014 I continue to believe Congress must find a solution to the Obamacare mess instead of providing bailouts to insurance companies,\\\" he said. But getting the deal through would require a sustained, focused lobbying effort on Capitol Hill, where Republicans are facing a biting political calculus. They\\u2019re still stinging from spending all of this year in a draining but fruitless effort to repeal and replace Obamacare \\u2014 the law that congressional Republicans have been trying to uproot for seven years. Now, they would have to decide whether the state flexibility concessions Alexander got are enough. \\u201cClearly it'd be helpful for President Trump to be on board\\u201d to win over conservatives, said a GOP senator. \\u201cI would think President Trump would find this appealing not as a solution \\u2014 no one's selling it as a solution \\u2014 but as a short-term measure to avoid over the next year and a half having continued instability in the marketplace.\\\" That senator, like many fellow Republicans, was reluctant to stake out a position, having only heard the broad-strokes outline from Alexander in a closed-door lunch meeting. House Republicans, who earlier this year approved an Obamacare repeal bill only to be left hung out to dry by the Senate, are even more skeptical. \\u201cThe GOP should focus on repealing & replacing Obamacare, not trying to save it. This bailout is unacceptable,\\u201d conservative Republican Study Committee Chairman Mark Walker said. \\\"Obamacare is in a 'death spiral.' Anything propping it up is only saving what Republicans promised to dismantle.\\u201d Conservative groups aren\\u2019t giving the deal any air cover to restore the subsidies, which cover out-of-pocket medical bills for low-income people. The insurers legally have to make those payments, whether the government keeps the subsidies flowing or not. The uncertainty over the subsidies is why some insurers fled the Obamacare markets \\u2014 and those that stayed raised premiums to cover the costs. The Heritage Foundation said funding the cost-sharing program would \\u201cprop up the subsidized Obamacare exchange market but would do absolutely nothing to stabilize\\u201d the broader market. \\u201cWhat is instead needed to stabilize the unsubsidized market is the removal of Obamacare\\u2019s cost increasing insurance mandates and misguided regulations,\\u201d said Ed Haislmaier, a health policy expert at The Heritage Foundation. \\\"Obamacare doesn't need a lifeline,\\\" Club for Growth spokesperson Rachael Slobodien emailed POLITICO. \\\"Its cord needs to be pulled.\\\" Freedom Partners also pushed back hard, urging conservatives in Congress to insist that any compromise include an elimination of Obamacare's individual and employer mandates. But Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), who has worked with Alexander to whip up support, expressed confidence that Trump could persuade skeptical Republicans to fall in line. \\\"The fact that the president has indicated a real interest in seeing a bipartisan fix like this move forward for a short-term fix is critical,\\\" Rounds said. \\\"If the White House said, 'Look, we're not interested in it,' then I don't think we'd be able to go anyplace with it.\\\" Democrats on Tuesday were eager to hear more. They have a much lower political risk to signing on: They want to see the health care law succeed and would love for Republicans to have more political ownership of the law and the 2018 premium rates. As part of the deal to reinstate the subsidies, Democrats agreed that states could allow a new catastrophic health plan \\u2014 a so-called copper plan along with the more generous gold, silver and bronze \\u2014 that would cost less but still include the basic package of Obamacare benefits. The clock is ticking. Alexander and Murray are trying to enact a bill that could have an effect on 2018 premiums, the vast majority of which have already been set by insurance companies and approved by states. The lawmakers say they\\u2019re trying to add into the bill assurances that savings would have to be passed on to consumers but have not yet released details. Alexander said Tuesday that he\\u2019d like to have a \\u201csignificant\\u201d number of Republican and Democratic co-sponsors by the end of this week. From there, he says, he wants to hand off the legislation to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to figure out how to enact it. Alexander knows he has his work cut out for him. Throughout weeks of negotiations, he has repeatedly said that he would only push forward a plan that he believes could get \\u201csignificant\\u201d bipartisan support, including concessions designed to appeal to his party's more ardent Obamacare opponents. A summary of the proposal circulated Tuesday appeared aimed at accomplishing just that, emphasizing that the deal would cut premiums, shift power to the states and avoid adding a penny to the deficit. It included a warning: If Republicans don't act now, the resulting chaos will provide a \\\"four-lane highway\\\" for Democrats to speed toward single-payer health care. If Alexander can get enough Republican support, a stand-alone bill seems unlikely, in part because some Republicans are fearful of tying up the Senate floor with a return to the contentious Obamacare debate. The more likely option is to attach it to another piece of legislation. Some Democrats are eyeing a year-end spending bill as an option. McConnell on Tuesday didn\\u2019t commit to the timing of a possible vote. \\u201cWe haven't had a chance to think about the way forward yet,\\u201d he told reporters. Murray said Tuesday afternoon that it'll now be solely up to Senate Republican leaders to figure out what comes next. She and Alexander came up with the product. As for the process of getting it passed, she said, \\\"ask Mitch.\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\":
