Why isn\\u2019t he bothered by all the things others find appalling and frightening? Thanksgiving weekend is here, so it\\u2019s time for my Republican brother to share his bounteous harvest of thoughts: Every time I hear Neil Gorsuch\\u2019s name, I smile. It has been a year since Donald Trump was elected, and his thrill-a-minute White House is still causing acid reflux for half the country and all of the mainstream media. There is always a lot of background noise buzzing around the president, and it\\u2019s catnip for his detractors. Full disclosure: I am not a Trump disciple. His manners offend me and the tweeting is overdone, but I do admire his resiliency against an unrelenting and unfair press. His tweeting is annoying, but it can be an effective defense. He has 43.2 million Twitter followers. The New York Times has 3.1 million subscribers. Trump got into office because of Congress\\u2019s inability or unwillingness to do its job. The voters were so fed up, they turned to a reality TV star instead of the 20 politicians on the menu. (Or 20.5 if you want to count Martin O\\u2019Malley.) Trump delivered on his promises to shake things up with a slew of executive orders undoing much of Barack Obama\\u2019s burdensome regulations and, more important, started to reshape the lower courts decimated by Obama\\u2019s appointments. The nomination of Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court may be his most lasting legacy. Trump\\u2019s presidency is unorthodox, but his blustering against Kim Jong-un is the only way to deal with a bully. And since Kim will want to get back at Trump, and Kim\\u2019s rockets may be able to reach only the West Coast, we\\u2019re probably all right until he can hit a red state. Democrats say Obamacare needs only a tweak. My youngest son just received his bill for health care. It came with an annual premium of $8,100. At that price, I think he will continue to vote Republican. The dam has broken on sexual harassment and worse. It has already claimed Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey and Charlie Rose and threatens to make a ghost town of Hollywood and the Capitol. It has also brought back Bill Clinton for an unwanted encore of his colorful past. At the center of it is the Republican Senate candidate in Alabama, Roy Moore. Moore is despicable. But the seat is very important. He still may win, but it will be a Pyrrhic victory when his own colleagues refuse to seat him and ask the governor to send over a new name. It was not surprising that the president said he would rather have a Republican in the seat. It will not be Roy Moore. Moore will never be seated. But the Republicans do have a problem. They are in total control and have not passed any major legislation. They cannot let large egos \\u2014 theirs and Trump\\u2019s \\u2014 get in the way of this opportunity. They are also facing a rear-guard attack by Steve Bannon, who brings his own army of candidates with him. I\\u2019m not a Bannon fan. But he\\u2019s holding Republicans\\u2019 feet to the fire, which should be done. If Republicans cannot pass tax reform, they are not Republicans and deserve to be fired. They were elected to get results. Early in my sales career, we learned that a new manager was on the way. We quickly called the office where he worked to get a profile on what to expect. The report came back, \\u201cWell, he is a real difficult guy to like \\u2026 but a real easy guy to hate.\\u201d Over the next two years, our office had its highest production in history. The manager was promoted to another sales office. Everyone still hated him. The promotion was for results. Results matter. The Democrats have their own issues. Their leaders are all on Medicare and cling to power like a drunk hugging his bottle of schnapps at last call. Liz and Bernie want the party to be more liberal, as if that were possible. If they move any further left, they will be driving in Britain. Their more pressing problem is Hillary, now in exile on her endless book tour. She continues to hover above the party like some giant pterodactyl of Christmas Past. Here is my holiday list of Things That Do Not Bother Me: Trump\\u2019s daily activity: I do not follow every move he makes. I counsel my Democratic friends to do the same, but they cannot help themselves. Trump\\u2019s minor battles: The N.F.L. players were disrespecting the American flag and were not called out by their gutless commissioner in a timely fashion. LaVar Ball is a publicity whore who cannot grasp that his son (and meal ticket) would have gone to jail without the president\\u2019s intervention. Trump\\u2019s interaction with dictators: If President Obama had done it, he would have been given the Nobel Peace Prize. (That already happened?) Robert Mueller\\u2019s investigation: So far, no direct connection with Trump himself on the Russia collusion. But it did find collusion with Hillary and the D.N.C. on the dossier. Luckily, she has several donors on Mueller\\u2019s staff ready to offer legal advice. Trump pressuring the Department of Justice: If Jeff Sessions cannot find prosecutable evidence against James Comey, Loretta Lynch and Hillary, he should go back to the Senate. Nepotism: Ivanka and Jared? Surely you jest. In the grand scheme of things, I don\\u2019t think they have any effect on anything. If this were a movie, they wouldn\\u2019t even be in the credits. I hope you had a happy Thanksgiving.\",\n          \"DUBAI (Reuters) - Kuwaiti authorities have detained a state employee suspected of belonging to the Islamic State-linked \\u201cCyber Caliphate Army\\u201d, and hacking official websites of foreign countries to spread militant ideology, local media reported on Friday. The Arabic-language al-Watan and al-Qabas reported that the 26-year-old man identified as Othman Zebn Nayef was arrested after months of surveillance. Al-Qabas quoted the interior ministry\\u2019s public information department as saying in a statement that Nayef confessed to being \\u201ca main member of the so-called Caliphate Cyber Army\\u201d, believed to be the electronic arm of Islamic State. The English-language Arab Times, which carried a similar report, did not identify the department where he had worked, but said he was caught using his office computer to \\u201chack official social media sites of some \\u2018friendly and sister\\u2019 countries to spread the extremist thoughts of the so-called Islamic State\\u201d. The statement said Nayef\\u2019s arrest had helped capture two suspects in Iraq and one in Jordan on Thursday, but provided no further details. Kuwait has waged a crackdown on Islamist militants since a suicide bomber killed 27 people in an attack on a Shi\\u2019ite Muslim mosque in Kuwait city in June 2015. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack. In a separate report, al-Qabas said that around 150 Kuwaiti nationals and residents who hold no citizenship, known as Bidoon, were in Syria fighting within armed groups trying to topple President Bashar al-Assad, and that up to 11 have died in the fighting. The newspaper quoted unnamed sources as saying that some of those fighters have been trying to find ways to return home as they face \\u201cextortion\\u201d and robbery from fellow militants. The Kuwaiti government, an ally of the United States, has stepped up its monitoring of individuals and charities suspected of collecting donations for militants linked to al Qaeda in Syria and in Iraq. Reporting by Sami Aboudi; Editing by Dominic Evans\",\n          \"VANCOUVER, British Columbia \\u2014 Canada\\u2019s Department of Justice on Friday authorized an extradition hearing for a top executive of Huawei, the Chinese electronics giant, who is wanted on fraud charges in the United States. The case involving the executive, Meng Wanzhou, who is the chief financial officer and daughter of Huawei\\u2019s founder, has entangled Canada in a bitter dispute between the world\\u2019s two largest economies. On Dec. 1 Canadian police officers arrested Ms. Meng at the request of the United States, infuriating China. In January, the United States unveiled an indictment against Ms. Meng and Huawei, outlining what it said were the company\\u2019s efforts stretching over many years to steal trade secrets, obstruct a criminal investigation and evade American economic sanctions on Iran. Ms. Meng\\u2019s detention has created a rift in Chinese-Canadian relations. China detained several Canadians and sentenced a Canadian drug smuggler to death in what many in Canada viewed as retaliation. In a statement, Justice Department officials \\u201cissued an authority to proceed, formally commencing an extradition process in the case of Ms. Meng Wanzhou.\\u201d The department said that the decision followed its review of evidence in the case, and that it had been satisfied there was sufficient evidence to proceed. In its statement, the department stressed that the extradition hearing, which will begin at British Columbia\\u2019s Supreme Court on March 6, \\u201cis not a trial, nor does it render a verdict of guilt or innocence.\\u201d Rather, legal experts said, the court\\u2019s role in such cases is circumscribed, and includes determining whether the fraud accusations against Ms. Meng by the United States constitute a crime in Canada. \\u201cThe conduct for which extradition is sought must also be considered criminal in both the United States of America and in Canada,\\u201d the department said. David Martin, Ms. Meng\\u2019s lawyer, said on Friday that he was disappointed by the decision, calling the charges politically motivated. \\u201cOur client maintains that she is innocent of any wrongdoing and that the U.S. prosecution and extradition constitutes an abuse of the processes of law,\\u201d Mr. Martin said in a statement. His statement also referred to \\u201cthe political nature of the U.S. charges\\u201d and to President Trump\\u2019s stated willingness to intercede in the case if it would help secure a trade deal between the United States and China. Also, apparently alluding to the fact that violating United States sanctions on Iran is not a crime under Canadian law, Mr. Martin expressed concern that the \\u201cconduct alleged to be an offense in the U.S. would not be an offense in Canada.\\u201d [Want more Canadian coverage in your inbox? Sign up for our weekly Canada Letter newsletter.] But legal experts said the United States has cast the company\\u2019s effort to circumvent the sanctions as a fraud against banks, which is an offense under Canadian law. While court proceedings are underway, Ms. Meng will remain on bail, in Vancouver, British Columbia, where she and her husband own two homes. She must wear a GPS tracking device around her ankle. Assuming an extradition request clears the court, the matter would be referred to the country\\u2019s recently appointed justice minister, David Lametti, a former law professor at McGill University in Montreal who specialized in intellectual property. Huawei has a notable presence in Canada, including research centers in Vancouver, Ottawa, Montreal, and Waterloo, Ontario. It employs about 1,100 people in the country. As Huawei fights the extradition case, it has been undertaking a major public relations campaign. This week it published full-page advertisements in several newspapers in the United States, inviting journalists to visit its centers and interview employees under the title: \\u201cDon\\u2019t believe everything you hear. Come and See Us.\\u201d The company has also been trying to burnish its image in Canada where, among other things, it sponsors Hockey Night in Canada, a weekly ritual for many Canadians. The Canadian government is under pressure from the United States government to ban Huawei equipment from coming improvements to Canada\\u2019s wireless networks. American security agencies have expressed concern that Huawei gear can be turned into spy equipment for China, although they have offered no proof publicly to support those claims. With Ms. Meng\\u2019s extradition still pending, two Huawei subsidiaries pleaded not guilty on Thursday to fraud, trade secrets conspiracy and other charges in Seattle. A trial date was set for March 2020. Both the Seattle case and the extradition case involve charges by American officials that the company stole part of a smartphone testing robot known as Tappy from a T-Mobile lab in Bellevue, Wash., sometime before 2014.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"url\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 900,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-harris-mute-on-2020-ambitions-slams-trumps-immoral-policies-seeks-ban-on-weapons-of-war\",\n          \"https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/13/tillis-walker-trump-084733\",\n          \"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/474062-kelly-leads-mcsally-in-arizona-senate-race-poll\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"section\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 141,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"reader-center\",\n          \"investing\",\n          \"TERRORISM\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"publication\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Fox News\",\n          \"The Hill\",\n          \"Politico\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":21}],"source":["df_samples.head()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":23,"id":"5420d873","metadata":{"id":"5420d873","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1721882912616,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":443,"user":{"displayName":"Omar Jamil","userId":"11162659889060667994"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["df_samples.to_csv(\"/content/drive/My Drive/Project 266 files/sample_news.csv\")"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.9"},"colab":{"provenance":[],"machine_shape":"hm"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
