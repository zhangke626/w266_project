and white house aide rob blair. this story has been updated with additional developments monday. cnns jeff zeleny ted barrett betsy klein sarah westwood phil mattingly and vicky ward contributed to this report," (CNN)Former White House national security adviser John Bolton said Monday he is willing to testify — if he is subpoenaed — in the Senate's impeachment trial of President Donald Trump. Bolton issued a statement Monday after the courts did not rule whether he would be compelled to testify during the House's impeachment proceedings, saying he was trying to meet his ""obligations both as a citizen and as former national security adviser."" ""Accordingly, since my testimony is once again at issue, I have had to resolve the serious competing issues as best I could, based on careful consideration and study,"" Bolton said. ""I have concluded that, if the Senate issues a subpoena for my testimony, I am prepared to testify."" Bolton is potentially a crucial witness, as he had firsthand knowledge of many of the events that formed the House's impeachment of the President over his dealings with Ukraine. The House sought his testimony but ultimately never subpoenaed Bolton, and Democrats withdrew their subpoena for his former deputy after it was challenged in court, as Democrats wanted to move forward with their impeachment probe and not wait for the court's decision. Bolton's statement is likely to put new pressures from Democrats on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to allow witnesses in the Senate trial, which Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and Democratic House leaders have pushed for. ""It is now up to four Senate Republicans to support bringing in Mr. Bolton, and the other three witnesses, as well as the key documents we have requested to ensure all the evidence is presented at the onset of a Senate trial,"" Schumer said in a statement. ""Given that Mr. Bolton's lawyers have stated he has new relevant information to share, if any Senate Republican opposes issuing subpoenas to the four witnesses and documents we have requested they would make absolutely clear they are participating in a cover up."" But Bolton's statement is unlikely to change McConnell's strategy over Trump's impeachment trial, according to multiple GOP sources familiar with the matter. McConnell has rejected Democratic demands to require that the ground rules of the trial include testimony of Bolton and three other witnesses, along with documents withheld by the White House. He says such decisions about witnesses and documents should be made after opening arguments, though Democrats fear that's an attempt to prevent any witnesses from testifying at all. Several GOP sources familiar with the matter say that Bolton's Monday announcement will not sway McConnell. ""Not at all,"" one source said. McConnell plans to reiterate his view to Senate Republicans during a closed-door lunch on Tuesday, a source said.  Ultimately, issuing a subpoena for Bolton would require 51 votes in the Senate, meaning at least four Republicans would have to join 47 Democrats. Schumer said on the Senate floor Monday that Democrats would force senators to vote on the witnesses they were seeking, including Bolton. Bolton left a message with McConnell before he put out the statement to give him a heads up that it was coming, according to a source familiar with the matter. The White House was not informed. Impasse over impeachment articles continues Amid the Senate's impasse, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has yet to formally send the two impeachment articles to the Senate after the House passed them last month. Until the House formally sends the articles, McConnell has said the trial will not start. But he's dismissed the idea that Democrats can enact any concessions by withholding the articles. Pelosi had no advanced knowledge of Bolton's statement, but a senior Democratic aide said Pelosi's decision to withhold the articles played a role. ""We would not have this development absent the speaker's hold,"" the senior Democratic aide said. ""Another proof point that indicates the value of her strategy."" Pelosi tweeted Monday that Trump and McConnell ""have run out of excuses.""  ""They must allow key witnesses to testify, and produce the documents Trump has blocked, so Americans can see the facts for themselves,"" she said. ""The Senate cannot be complicit in the President's cover-up."" Lawmakers return to Washington this week to resume the impeachment fight that's largely in the same position it was before Congress left town for the holidays. The major developments with Iran have added a new wrinkle to the battle between congressional Democrats and the White House, but it's unlikely to shift the calculus on the impeachment trial.  Even as Congress balances two of its most profound powers  — authorizing war and impeaching a president — the looming Iowa caucuses also create a remarkable convergence heading into Trump's fourth year in office. It's an unlikely trio of distinct events — Iran, impeachment and Iowa — now inexplicably linked in a deeply divided capital and country. While Democratic candidates vying for the right to challenge Trump were already bracing to be overshadowed by impeachment in January, their primary fight could now be influenced by the party's divisions on foreign policy. Bolton looms over Senate Speaking on the Senate floor Monday, McConnell did not address Bolton's new statement but reiterated that he believes witnesses should be dealt with later in the trial. The Republican leader accused Pelosi and Democrats of playing ""political games"" with impeachment by withholding the articles. ""Speaker Pelosi is now sitting on the articles she claimed were so very urgent. She's delayed this indefinitely so that the architects of the failed House process can look for ways to reach over here into the Senate and dictate our process as well,"" McConnell said. ""These bizarre stunts do not serve our Constitution or our national security. They erode both."" Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, one of the Republican senators Democrats are eying to break ranks from McConnell on witnesses, told CNN on Monday ""of course"" he would like to hear from Bolton. ""I'd like to hear what he has to say,"" Romney said. Asked if he would vote to subpoena Bolton, however, Romney stopped short and said he first would want to know what the process is. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, another key GOP voice in the impeachment trial, said Monday that she views the trial in three stages -- presentations, then senator questions and then discussion over whether to have witnesses -- which lines up with McConnell's proposal. Collins said she's interested in hearing from Bolton in the third stage but showed no inclination to push to bring him in before that point. ""It's very difficult to decide that until we go through the first two stages,"" she said. Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican in Senate leadership, initially told reporters he ""has no objection"" to Bolton testifying ""by deposition or some pre-recorded testimony,"" but he later indicated he would not vote to subpoena him and warned against a ""circus-like atmosphere"" like the one he believes took place in the House.   He repeatedly said that he thought Bolton's testimony would be stifled by executive privilege that he said would likely be invoked by Trump on much of what Bolton would have to say.  ""He can't really waive executive privilege — it's not his to privilege, it's the President's privilege,"" Cornyn said. And Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the Senate's No. 2 Republican, rejected the calls for the Senate to subpoena Bolton, arguing that's a step the House should have taken during the impeachment inquiry. ""If it was supposed to be, I think they would have done it in the House,"" Thune said. ""To me, they could have subpoenaed him. They didn't.""  Bolton's testimony was sought in the House by Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, during the House's impeachment investigation into Trump's dealings with Ukraine. But Bolton's former deputy, Charles Kupperman, who has the same lawyer as Bolton, filed a lawsuit after he was subpoenaed, arguing the White House was directing him not to testify and the courts should decide the issue. Instead, the House withdrew its subpoena of Kupperman and did not issue a subpoena for Bolton after his attorney indicated he would go the same route. Bolton is one of several witnesses that House Democrats sought whom Senate Democrats are now pushing for in the Senate trial, including acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and White House aide Rob Blair. The new statement comes after Bolton was both surprised and curious that he had not been subpoenaed by the House, according to the source familiar with the matter. There had been mounting criticism that he wanted to hold off on sharing what he knew about the withholding of aid to Ukraine for his book. It is unclear what specifically triggered him to put out this statement right now. It is unclear what Bolton will do if the White House tries to block his testimony, or parts of it, the source said. But the statement speaks for itself in that he is prepared to provide testimony. This story has been updated with additional developments Monday.

White male anxieties were, evidently, greatly roiled by the spectacle of the strong black man, and had to be assuaged. The greater the black boxer (Joe Louis, Archie Moore, Ezzard Charles), the more urgent that he assume a public role of caution and restraint. Kindly white men who advised their black charges to be a “credit to their race” were not speaking ironically. And yet, the young Cassius Clay/Muhammad Ali refused to play this emasculating role. He would not be the “white man’s Negro” — he would not be anything of the white man’s at all. Converting to the Nation of Islam at the age of 22, immediately after winning the heavyweight championship from Sonny Liston, he denounced his “slave name” (Cassius Marcellus Clay, which was also his father’s name) and the Christian religion; in refusing to serve in the Army he made his political reasons clear: “I ain’t got no quarrel with them Vietcong.” An enormous backlash followed: where the young boxer had been cheered, now he was booed. Denunciations rained upon his head. Respected publications, including The New York Times, continued to print the “slave name” Cassius Clay for years. Sentenced to five years’ imprisonment for his refusal to comply with the draft, Ali stood his ground; he did not serve time, but was fined $10,000 and his boxing license was revoked so that he could not continue his professional career, in the very prime of that career. In a gesture of sheer pettiness the State Department took away his passport so that he couldn’t fight outside the country. After he was reinstated as a professional boxer three and a half years later, he had lost much of his youthful agility. Yet he’d never given in. The heart of the champion is this: One never repudiates one’s deepest values, one never gives in. Though Ali had risen to dizzying heights of fame in the 1960s, it was in the 1970s that his greatness was established. Who could have imagined that, being reinstated as a boxer after a lengthy suspension, Ali would expand the dimensions of the sport yet again; that, past his prime, his legs slowed, his breath shorter, out of an ingenuity borne of desperation he would reinvent himself as an athlete on whose unyielding body younger boxers might punch themselves out. He could no longer “float like a butterfly” but he could lie back against the ropes, like a living heavy bag, and allow an opponent like the hapless George Foreman to exhaust himself trying to knock him out. What is the infamous Rope-a-Dope stratagem of 1974 but a brilliantly pragmatic stoicism in which the end (winning) justifies the means (irreversible damage to body, brain). The spectator is appalled to realize that a single blow of Foreman’s delivered to a non-boxer might well be fatal; how many dozens of these blows Ali absorbed, as in a fairy tale in which the drama is one of reversed expectations. In this way, with terrible cost to come in terms of Ali’s health, he won back the heavyweight title at the age of 32, defeating the 25–year-old Foreman. Great as Ali-Foreman was, it can’t compare to the trilogy of fights between Ali and Joe Frazier in 1971, 1974 and 1975; Frazier won the first on points, Ali the second and third on points and a TKO. These were monumental fights, displays of human stamina, courage and “heart” virtually unparalleled in the history of boxing. In the first, Ali experienced the worst battering of his life, yet he did not give up; in the second and third, Ali won against an exhausted Frazier, at what cost to his health we can only guess — “The closest thing to dying,” Ali said of the last fight. Yet, incredibly, unconscionably, Ali was exploited by managers and promoters who should have protected him; his doomed career continued until 1981 with a devastating final loss, to the much-younger Trevor Berbick. Ali then retired, belatedly, after 61 fights, with 56 wins. What does it mean to say that a fighter has “heart”? By “heart” we don’t mean technical skill, nor even unusual strength and stamina and ambition; by “heart” we mean something like spiritual character. The mystery of Muhammad Ali is this spiritual greatness, that seemed to have emerged out of a far more ordinary, even callow personality. With the passage of time, the rebel who’d been reviled by many Americans would be transformed into an American hero, especially amid general disenchantment with the Vietnam War. The young man who’d been denounced as a traitor was transformed into the iconic figure of our time, a compassionate figure who seems to transcend race. A warm, sepia light irradiates the past, glossing out jarring details. Ali had long ago transcended his own origins and his own specific identity. As he’d once said: “Boxing was nothing. It wasn’t important at all. Boxing was just meant as a way to introduce me to the world.” OpinionWalter Mosley Opinion",The New York Times,opinion,225,great as aliforeman was it cant compare to the trilogy of fights between ali and joe frazier in 1971 and 1975 frazier won the first on points ali the second and third on points and a tko.,"{'rouge1': Score(precision=0.9459459459459459, recall=0.03932584269662921, fmeasure=0.07551240560949299), 'rouge2': Score(precision=0.8611111111111112, recall=0.03487064116985377, fmeasure=0.06702702702702704), 'rougeL': Score(precision=0.9459459459459459, recall=0.03932584269662921, fmeasure=0.07551240560949299)}",0.07551240560949299,0.06702702702702704,0.07551240560949299

The settlers there have pushed back as hard as they can, screaming from rooftops, threatening the government and deriding Israel’s High Court, which ordered the evacuation on the grounds that some of the houses there were illegally built on privately owned land. But ultimately they will have to leave. The government — even if reluctantly — abides by the law and will follow the court’s ruling. The deadline for the evacuation is Dec. 25. In today’s political conversation both inside Israel and outside, it’s now a cliché that the settler movement has an undue influence over the Israeli government. But the Amona evacuation is evidence, once again, that this common knowledge is wrong. This is not the first time Amona, an outpost of about 40 families, has become a major point of contention for Israel. The government evacuated houses in the settlement once before, in 2006. There were violent clashes between the settlers and the Israeli police, but the evacuation ended as the government had planned. That event, not long after Prime Minister Ariel Sharon evacuated 25 settlements in Gaza and the West Bank, shook the country and deepened the rift between the settler movement and the rest of Israel. Since then, Amona has been a symbol of sorts. The settlers learned a lesson and also taught one to the government: Evacuating settlements can quickly turn ugly. That’s only one reason the current Israeli government is less than enthusiastic about having to evacuate Amona. In addition to fears of clashes with the settlers, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government will have to act against its own constituency, a plurality of which would like the evacuation avoided. And yet the government has little choice. Attempts to circumvent the court’s orders legislatively, by introducing a law to make the settlements legal by forcing the owners of the land to accept compensation, have failed. Mr. Netanyahu now finds himself in a situation like that of right-wing prime ministers before him: Ariel Sharon, one of the fathers of the settlement movement, evacuated settlers from Gaza. Ehud Olmert, a longtime Likud Party minister, clashed with the settlers of Amona in 2006. It is now Mr. Netanyahu’s turn to make clear that the dog wags the tail — the Israeli government evacuates settlers when it needs to do so. The idea that the settlers are the true movers and shakers of Israel’s policies in the occupied territories is convenient for both Israel’s detractors and defenders. For critics, it is proof that Israel does not truly seek peace and that it is hardly a country of law and order. It is proof that militias of armed citizens, their politically active lobbyists and the public behind them control Israel’s actions, and hence that any attempt to negotiate with the democratically elected government of Israel is futile. For Israel’s defenders, it is also convenient to make the settlers the scapegoat for all of Israel’s supposed sins. It is not us — it is them. The bad people, the occupiers, are the unruly, armed, bearded zealots, settlers whom we cannot control. Israel, in this telling, wants peace, but its quirky political system gives too much power to small ideological groups and so the country cannot overcome settlers’ obstructionism. But there is ample evidence in Israel’s political history that the settlers do not have veto power over government policy. They failed to prevent Menachem Begin’s government from withdrawing from the Sinai Peninsula in the early 1980s. They failed to prevent Yitzhak Rabin’s government from signing the Oslo accord in 1993. They failed to prevent the Sharon government from pulling out close to 15,000 settlers and their allies from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. And they will fail to prevent the evacuation of Amona in the coming weeks. All this does not mean that the settlers have no influence on Israel’s policies. They do. They have the backing of many Israelis, and of many politicians. They have influential lobbyists. They are more dedicated to their ideology than most other Israelis, and they are willing to invest their energy and time in advancing their goals. They should be admired, not denigrated, for these qualities. They are exemplary citizens — involved, patriotic, highly engaged and serious. The policies they preach are the problem. Most Israelis — at least for now — do not want Israel to annex the West Bank and become a binational state. Most Israelis — at least for now — want Israel to remain a country of laws. The settlers’ attempt to blur the line between Israel and the Palestinians doesn’t sit well with Israelis’ desire for separation from the Palestinians. But the West Bank settlers are a small minority: about 350,000 citizens in a country of eight million. Their staunch supporters have power in the Parliament, but it is hardly unlimited. When Amona is evacuated, it will be useful to be reminded that whenever the power of settlers was tested against a firm government, they were on the losing end. They don’t deserve the blame for Israel’s actions or its inaction. They are just one of many groups shaping Israeli policy toward the Palestinians — but hardly the main driver of meaningful political decisions.

In June, Mexico’s government averted a threat by U.S. President Donald Trump to impose tariffs on all Mexican exports by vowing to take tougher measures to curb a surge in U.S.-bound migrants within 90 days. In late July, after an initial 45-day period to evaluate progress, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo praised Mexico’s efforts, but said he would circle back with Trump about how to proceed. The Trump administration has pressured Mexico to become a so-called safe third country for asylum seekers, which would require Central Americans to apply for refuge in Mexico rather than the United States. Mexico has rejected that demand, saying the measure is inappropriate and unnecessary. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador struck an upbeat tone at his regular morning news conference on Monday when he noted the 90-day period would conclude on Sept. 5. “We’re fulfilling the commitment we made... We’re doing well,” he said. Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard echoed Lopez Obrador’s optimism on Mexico’s measures to curb the flow of migrants. “I’d say they’re now in a state close to normalcy,” he told reporters, referring to migrant flows. He added that he would travel to Washington for the Sept. 10 meeting. Migrant apprehensions on the U.S. southern border fell in June to about 100,000 people, according to U.S. data, after Mexico imposed new measures, including deploying militarized National Guard police to its borders. Central American countries have also faced pressure from Trump to do more to slow migration. Under threat of sanctions, Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales last month struck a “safe third country” agreement with the United States, meaning Hondurans and Salvadorans would be required to seek refuge in Guatemala, rather than proceeding north.

The announcement comes a day after Kane was convicted on charges of perjury and obstruction. Critics had called for her to step down right away. The resignation will be effective at the close of business Wednesday. The new acting attorney general will be Bruce L. Castor Jr., Kane's top deputy, office spokesman Jeffrey Johnson said. In the statement, Kane said: ""I have been honored to serve the people of Pennsylvania and I wish them health and safety in all their days."" Kane will be sentenced later. The felony offense of perjury carries a potential jail term, and prosecutor Kevin Steele said jail time may be recommended.  ""It seemed that we had somebody who felt that she was above the law, and that's not the case because no one is above the law,"" he said. ""We are a very honorable profession here. We have rules that we have to abide by and there are no exceptions to that."" Kane, a Democrat elected in 2012, had denied leaking confidential information about grand jury deliberations to the media in an effort to harm her predecessor and then attempting to cover it up. Defense attorney Gerald Shargel told reporters outside the court that the verdict was ""a crushing blow."" ""We will continue this litigation, we will continue this fight because we believe that our client has been wrongfully accused of misconduct,"" he said. Bribery investigation The criminal charges were filed against Kane in August 2015. They alleged that Kane acted on anger about a local newspaper article that accused her of dropping an investigation into politicians accepting bribes. To get back at her predecessors, the complaint said Kane leaked sealed, confidential grand jury documents to the media and then lied under oath. Kane said in an August 10, 2015, statement that a campaign of political retribution had been launched against her long before the allegations at the center of the criminal complaint. The entire episode, Kane claimed, began with a series of ""pornographic, racial and religiously offensive emails"" from the office of former Attorney General Tom Corbett -- who was elected governor in 2010 -- and uncovered in an investigation. She called for the release of the emails, but Judge William Carpenter blocked the move under what Kane called ""a tortured interpretation of our state's grand jury secrecy law."" Her attorney addressed the issue with reporters after the verdict. ""We believe that our defense was compromised, and we will fight that till the end,"" Shargel said. ""We have arguments to make on whether this trial was fair. We intend to pursue all arguments that are available to us. We're not going to walk away from any arguments."" On resignation In a statement Monday, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf said the charges were ""unbecoming of the Commonwealth's top law enforcement officer."" ""As I have made clear, I do not believe Kathleen Kane should be Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. I believed this when she was charged, and today, after conviction, there should be no question that she should resign immediately,"" Wolf said in a statement. ""While there is no simple procedure to remove a civil officer, the Office of Attorney General and its employees, as well as the people of Pennsylvania, deserve to move on. I implore Attorney General Kane to do what is right: put the commonwealth's residents first and step down from office."" Kane had resisted earlier calls to step down, saying resignation would be an admission of guilt ""and I'm not guilty."" Kane denies charges After Kane's conviction, Pennsylvania Republican Party Chairman Rob Gleason said it was ""a terrible day for the commonwealth.""

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN.  (CNN)One of my good friends and one of the kindest human beings I have ever met worked to make me a second-class citizen. Matthew Dowd was President George W. Bush's chief strategist during the 2004 presidential election, an election cycle that saw the leader of the free world endorse a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, thus weaponizing bigotry to get re-elected.  Watching your dignity and civil rights be diminished into a Sunday morning talking point was humiliating, and when I met Dowd years later, being in the presence of a man who contributed to this humiliation initially filled me with anger. But then I chose not to submit to that anger. And because of that, I gained a friend.  More importantly I kept my power. Ellen DeGeneres, who is under fire from some for sitting next to and sharing laughs with President Bush during the Dallas Cowboys-Green Bay Packers game last Sunday, knows very well what it is like to be targeted for being LGBTQ. Undoubtedly, she remembers the humiliation and fear of 2004. She also remembers the pain of losing her career, arguably for being gay, after her sitcom, ""Ellen,"" was cancelled in 1998.  This strikes a particularly strong chord for me because I too came out in 1998. I too remember all that I lost in doing so. And like her, I too have shared laughs with some of the very people who contributed to the vilification of my community many years later. Not because we are sell-outs. Not because we have forgotten. But because anger cannot be the sole fuel propelling us on life's journey. We also need love, for without it, we are no better than those who fear us.  To live with anger is to live powerless. That's not to say the oppressed should never be angered by the actions of their oppressor. Only that anger can spark a movement but it should not order its steps. Not if the goal of the movement is peace.  To those who believe DeGeneres' actions were some sort of betrayal, I ask what significant civil rights movement occurred without support from those on the ""other side?"" Would women have gained the right to vote without men in Congress supporting the 19th Amendment? Of course not. Tweets can inform, protests garner attention, but changing hearts and minds requires genuine human interaction. Like the kind captured in a photograph in which DeGeneres and Bush dared to sit next to each other and share a laugh.  The two may still be on opposite sides when it comes to LGBTQ issues or any one of the litany of issues Bush decided as President during his eight years in the White House. They may be on the same side in terms of enjoying their status as one-percenters. Who knows? But clearly, they found common ground in treating each other with respect.  And for the life of me, I can see no harm in that.  Besides, as former Congressman Barney Frank likes to say, ""if you're not at the table, you're on the menu."" Where some saw a sell-out in Ellen DeGeneres last Sunday, I saw a woman who once lost everything as an appetizer and who fought and clawed her way back to owning the restaurant.   So yes, be angry for what Bush, Dowd -- who has since apologized -- and others did 15 years ago. Be angry for what the Trump administration is doing now. But do not allow that anger to be so consuming that you hand your joy over to people who wish to bathe in your tears. They don't deserve to have that much power.

communications inc,"Secretary of State John KerryJohn Forbes KerryTrump's winning weapon: Time The Memo: O'Rourke looks to hit reset button #FreeAustinTice trending on anniversary of kidnapping in Syria MORE recently announced that the U.S. will work with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to create new refugee processing centers in Central America. The plan will bring much needed safety and stability to refugees fleeing countries with some of the highest murder rates in the world. But more can be done. The Obama administration can further alleviate humanitarian crisis by launching a privately-funded refugee resettlement program, empowering U.S. philanthropists to cover the costs of refugees in their first year. This public-private partnership would save lives without requiring new congressional appropriations. The unfortunate reality is that there are more refugees—over 19.5 million—around the world today than at any other time since World War II. Syria has received much attention as of late, but a devastating crisis is also happening in our hemisphere. The so-called “Northern Triangle” of Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador is home to unspeakable violence and oppression. The Council on Foreign Relations reports that forced gang recruitment, violence, and civil war in these countries has pushed thousands out of their homes. What’s more, over one-hundred thousand unaccompanied Northern Triangle minors have come to the U.S. from October 2013 to July 2015. These Central American nations are among the top 10 countries with the highest rates of homicide. Two of them— El Salvador and Honduras— are so violent that the Peace Corps has suspended operations there. Many have calculated that the risk of using human smugglers to come to the U.S. is better than staying in place. Despite this, the 2016 refugee ceiling for Latin America and the Caribbean is set at just 3,000. Creating new processing centers is definitely a step in the right direction—but without increasing the number of refugees this year, more will take the dangerous journey to the U.S., risking death in the process. Kerry recently acknowledged this, arguing that the U.S. should offer, “families and individuals a safe and legal alternative to the dangerous journey that many are tempted to begin, making them at that instant easy prey for human smugglers.” In 2014, the American people donated an astonishing $350 billion to charities. Yet under the current system, donations cannot be used to help bring in additional refugees. Our country's vast resources and uniquely active philanthropic culture sit idly on the sidelines as the death toll rises. The Obama administration should harness this wealth and energy by tying the refugee admissions cap to private giving. Here’s how it might work. The government would open an account into which individuals and charities can channel donations. Once a certain donation threshold is met, new refugee slots would open up automatically. This would allow more Central American refugees to make the journey to the U.S. safely and legally, but with little additional burden on taxpayers. The UNHCR has endorsed this idea, and billionaire philanthropist George Soros has expressed interest.  Imagine how much money would be raised if crowdfunding platforms were set up, or “text-to-donate” campaigns launched. Many millions of dollars could be raised to save the lives of families fleeing violence in Central America. Private sponsorship works. The Reagan administration’s “Private Sector Initiative” empowered ethnic charities to collect contributions that would go towards increasing the overall number of refugees admitted. Five organizations were involved and resettled nearly 16,000 refugees in addition to the government-sponsored cap. In Canada, over 225,000 refugees have been privately resettled since 1979, by fully embracing the work of Canadian citizens, non-profit organizations, and charity institutions. Canada’s privately sponsored refugees report better outcomes than government-sponsored refugees in the majority of cases, such as satisfaction of resettlement and quicker labor force entry. The success of these efforts led the UN to recognize the people of Canada for excellence in service to refugees.   Though Central American refugees pose very little security risk, they are rigorously screened. The recently intensified process takes 18-24 months, is very thorough, and is trusted by national security experts.  For many refugees, this is literally a life or death situation. We need to help. Privately funded refugee resettlement is an easy way to bring new resources to the refugee program without new congressional appropriations. It would create an outlet for America’s abundant generosity and provide a timely, robust response to a serious humanitarian crisis. Privately funded refugee resettlement is not a silver bullet, but it can alleviate some of the suffering of those displaced by violence and civil strife. It’s time to launch a privately funded refugee resettlement account and ramp up the life-saving process of resettlement for our Central American neighbors.   La Corte is a research associate at the Niskanen Center who specializes in immigration policy.

The postponement of the March 20 jury trial was a precautionary measure due to the number of people traveling to attend, according to a spokesman for New York Attorney General Letitia James. A new trial was not set but a hearing will be held April 14 to decide next steps in the case, which is in state court in Suffolk County on New York’s Long Island.

Analysts have been watching to see if the companies would settle before the trial, which could provide a framework for a deal to resolve thousands of lawsuits against the companies. The last opioid trial that was scheduled to start in October led to a last-minute $260 million settlement between two Ohio counties and three major drug distributors and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (TEVA.TA). The October trial also helped push drug distributors McKesson, Cardinal Health Inc (CAH.N) and AmerisourceBergen Corp (ABC.N) and drugmakers Teva and J&J to propose settling all of the cases against them for $48 billion, although they have struggled to secure support for the deal. More than 3,000 lawsuits, which have mostly been brought by state and local governments, are pending against drug companies over the opioid crisis. Many of them are consolidated before a federal judge in Cleveland. In the only major opioid trial, J&J was ordered to pay $465 million to Oklahoma last year to help alleviate the epidemic. More than 400,000 overdose deaths have been attributed to opioids in the United States since 1997, and the lawsuits generally accuse the companies of downplaying the risks of the drugs or failing to stop suspicious orders. Mallinckrodt Plc (MNK.N) last month proposed a $1.6 billion global settlement, and Purdue Pharma LP has a proposed a deal to settle its cases for at least $10 billion.

Sanders said Wednesday that the president had had ""direct conversations"" with Boy Scout leaders but ""not actual phone calls"" with the group. ""I wouldn't say it was a lie,"" Sanders told reporters at the daily briefing, after one journalist asked whether the president had lied by describing the conversation as a phone call. ""That's a pretty bold accusation. The conversations took place. They just simply didn't take place over a phone call. ... He had them in person."" ""Multiple members of the Boy Scout leadership following his speech there that day congratulated him, praised him and offered ... quite powerful compliments following his speech, and those were what those references were about,"" Sanders said. She gave a similar explanation about a phone call Trump said Monday he'd had with the president of Mexico about the United States' border policies. Mexico said the call never happened. Sanders said Trump was actually referring to a conversation the two leaders had at the G-20 summit in Germany last month. President Randall Stephenson and Chief Scout Executive Mike Surbaugh are the Scouts' top leaders, but neither has disclosed any communication with Trump or his administration. Surbaugh wrote an apology letter to members after Trump’s speech distancing the Scouts from Trump. He noted that inviting presidents to the celebration is a long-standing Scout tradition and urged the Scouts to look past the divisive moment and toward emulating Scout values. “While we live in a challenging time in a country divided along political lines, the focus of Scouting remains the same today as every day,” Surbaugh wrote on July 27.",Politico,,308,trumps meandering politically charged speech to the boy scouts last month was widely panned as inappropriate but the president told the wall street journal in an interview last week that he got a call from the head of the boy scouts saying it was the greatest speech that was ever made to them politico published the transcript of that interview tuesday.,"{'rouge1': Score(precision=1.0, recall=0.15024630541871922, fmeasure=0.26124197002141325), 'rouge2': Score(precision=0.9833333333333333, recall=0.145679012345679, fmeasure=0.2537634408602151), 'rougeL': Score(precision=1.0, recall=0.15024630541871922, fmeasure=0.26124197002141325)}",0.26124197002141325,0.2537634408602151,0.26124197002141325

and secret wires Judge Napolitano's Chambers: Judge Andrew Napolitano explains why special counsel Robert Mueller indicted two former Trump associates in the Russian investigation even though Trump wasn't directly connected to their charges. Earlier this week, the government revealed that a grand jury sitting in Washington, D.C., indicted a former Trump presidential campaign chairman and his former deputy and business partner for numerous felonies. Both were accused of working as foreign agents and failing to report that status to the federal government, using shell corporations to launder income and obstruction of justice by lying to the federal government. The financial crimes are alleged to have occurred from 2008 to 2014, and the obstruction charges from 2014 to 2017. At the same time it announced the above, the government revealed that a low-level former foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, George Papadopoulos, had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and become a government witness. Does any of this relate to President Donald Trump? Here is the back story. At the same time that Paul Manafort and his business partner Rick Gates were guiding the Trump campaign in the summer of 2016, Russian agents were manipulating American social media sites so as to arouse chaos in general and animosity toward Hillary Clinton in particular. The Department of Justice appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as independent counsel to determine whether any Americans had criminally helped the Russians. The alleged crimes of Manafort and Gates appear to have nothing to do with Trump, nor have they any facial relationship to the Russians. So why were these two indicted by a grand jury hearing evidence about alleged American assistance to Russian interference with the 2016 presidential campaign? When prosecutors confront a complex series of potentially criminal events, they often do not know at the outset of their investigation where the evidence will lead them. Sometimes they come upon a person who they believe has knowledge of facts they seek and that person declines to speak with them. Such a refusal to speak to the government is perfectly lawful in America, yet it often triggers a prosecution of the potential witness so that prosecutors may squeeze him -- not literally, of course -- for evidence to which they believe he can lead them. The ultimate target of Mueller’s investigation is President Trump. It is standard operating procedure when prosecutors have a high-level target to charge those below the target with something just to get them to cooperate. Though the charges against Manafort and Gates need not be related to the Russians or to Trump, they must be real. It&aposs clear they are, as each is facing more than 20 years in prison. Mueller believes that that prospect is enough to dispatch their lawyers to make deals with him. The danger of such a deal is that Manafort and Gates may offer to tell Mueller what they think he wants to hear -- even if it is not truthful -- so that they can have their prison exposure lessened. There is more danger in the seemingly smallest of this week’s Mueller-generated events. Papadopoulos was interviewed voluntarily by the FBI on Jan. 27. He was arrested on July 27 for lying to FBI agents during that interview. In a secret federal court proceeding on Oct. 5, he pleaded guilty. In a profound miscarriage of justice, federal law permits FBI agents to lie to us but makes it a crime for us to lie to them. Nevertheless, why was the Papadopoulos guilty plea kept secret? What was he doing between his arrest and his plea and between his plea and its revelation? Judges are very reluctant to close their courtroom doors in any criminal proceeding, even if both the prosecutors and the defense counsel request it. The public has a right to know whom the government is prosecuting and what deals or punishments it may be obtaining. Yet if prosecutors can convince a judge that public knowledge of the existence of a guilty plea might harm an ongoing criminal investigation, the judge can keep the plea secret. That is apparently what happened here. It appears that Papadopoulos was gathering evidence for Mueller, probably by talking to his former Trump campaign colleagues while wired -- a process that would have been fruitless if his guilty plea had become public. Because Papadopoulos admitted under oath that he lied to FBI agents, the courts will treat his guilt as certain. That gives Mueller great leverage with him. It also gives Papadopoulos great incentive to help Mueller -- truthfully or not -- because he knows he is going to federal prison. He also knows that if Mueller likes what he hears, a five-year prison term could be reduced to six months. Hence, Papadopoulos could be a treasure-trove for Mueller on the production of any evidence linking the Trump campaign and the Russians and any evidence of Trump’s personal knowledge or acquiescence. Papadopoulos has already produced a wild tale about meetings with a Russian professor and a female Russian government agent in London that the FBI apparently believes. Is this any way to conduct a prosecution? I have argued for years that squeezing defendants and witnesses by threats and promises to get them to spill the beans is a form of extortion or bribery -- not much different from the extortion and bribery that the government regularly prosecutes. ""You tell us what we want to hear and we will ask a judge to go easy on you. If not, you will suffer great losses."" It is bad enough that the feds can legally lie to us and get away with it, but can they also legally threaten and bribe witnesses to testify against us and get away with it? Can they do this to the president? In a word, yes. My arguments have fallen on deaf ears. Squeezing witnesses and defendants is a way of life for federal prosecutors.

Mr. Wynn, the casino mogul, who bears that waxy look we associate with Las Vegas wealth — tanned skin, coifed hair and unnaturally white teeth — has been accused of sexual misconduct. In the recent cultural movement during which many powerful men have been publicly accused of sexual harassment, Mr. Wynn is the first who is a C.E.O. of a publicly traded company in an industry that primarily employs hourly wage earners: casino workers, waitresses, housekeepers, and others who punch a clock every workday. Compared with his accusers, Mr. Wynn is extraordinarily powerful. He has 11,000 employees in Las Vegas alone and has solidified his influence with millions of dollars in political contributions. The allegations against him should remind us of the vast economic disparities that make low-paid women especially vulnerable to misconduct by their wealthy bosses. On Friday, The Wall Street Journal provided a detailed report of Mr. Wynn’s purported patterns of sexual misconduct against female employees. Mr. Wynn has denied the allegations. According to the report, he exposed himself in front of women, in an on-site office, who were assigned to provide him spa services. He’s accused of repeatedly pressuring them into unwanted sexual acts. I’ve already heard people suggesting that my city is to blame for Mr. Wynn — that the Las Vegas Strip’s overtly sexualized culture enables powerful men like him to maintain their patterns of sexual harassment. That may have contributed, but when it comes to women facing workplace abuse, another dynamic does just as much harm: the culture of income inequality. The report of Mr. Wynn’s misconduct reminds me, a casino worker, of every time a manager stepped across the line or a V.I.P. guest’s behavior was excused because of his financial status. Here, low-income workers are made to feel indebted to the rich men like Mr. Wynn who pay their wages. In a city with little economic diversity, good middle-class jobs like those offered by Wynn Resorts are difficult to find. The women coming forward were lower-paid employees at the times of the alleged harassment. They were hospitality workers trained to be welcoming and smiling, and to always strive to say yes. Most of Mr. Wynn’s accusers had behind-the-scenes roles like food and beverage servers, manicurists and receptionists, employees whom executives often view as easily replaceable. It is a similar approach taken by Harvey Weinstein, who preyed on female actors when they had little power — before their Hollywood debuts or successes. What many powerful sexual harassers seem to know is that when women don’t have the economic agency or career security to speak out, they often will choose not to. There is a reported $7.5 million settlement between Mr. Wynn and his former manicurist, which prohibits her from speaking publicly about her experience. Many working-class and low-income women who never report misconduct are informally making similar deals, on a much smaller scale. Each day at work, they may decide to remain silent about sexual harassment for the sake of their families and their own sense of safety, in exchange for a much-needed paycheck from someone who has astronomical wealth. It is exceptionally brave for any low-income woman who speaks out, but there is a reason Mr. Wynn’s accusers have remained unnamed: They do not have a legion of Twitter followers to mobilize around them, or people of power to affirm them, or forthcoming movies to support them financially. Socioeconomic status plays a significant role in their ability to say, “Me too.” The majority of our wage work force is women, like those who brought allegations against Mr. Wynn. Women are the most common victims of sexual harassment. Without ensuring that all women have a living wage and the right to unionize — things that provide the security an employee needs before she even thinks about reporting misconduct — we will never end the problem. Meanwhile, Mr. Wynn will be fine. That’s no surprise. Our current president offers just one example of the way men above a certain income bracket seem to avoid career-ending consequences for accusations — or even videotaped admissions — of sexual misconduct. Mr. Wynn, whose fortune will buy him the best attorneys, is likely to remain comfortably and safely at the top. He may lose some money or no longer be invited onto Fox News, and on Saturday he resigned his position as finance chairman of the Republican National Committee. But the wealth he already has means that unlike his accusers, he’ll never have to worry about making enough to get by. It’s that kind of financial security that creates empowerment. When I drive to my workplace on the Las Vegas Strip, I still have to see the names “Trump” and “Wynn” crowning the towers that form our skyline. For years to come, many women will still have to see those names printed on their uniforms, their work identification badges and their paychecks.",The New York Times,opinion,267,in the recent cultural movement during which many powerful men have been publicly accused of sexual harassment mr wynn is the first who is a ceo.,"{'rouge1': Score(precision=0.9615384615384616, recall=0.029069767441860465, fmeasure=0.0564334085778781), 'rouge2': Score(precision=0.96, recall=0.027939464493597205, fmeasure=0.05429864253393665), 'rougeL': Score(precision=0.9615384615384616, recall=0.029069767441860465, fmeasure=0.0564334085778781)}",0.0564334085778781,0.05429864253393665,0.0564334085778781

Several of the 76 signatories, who include members of Libya’s rival parliaments and more than 20 tribal leaders, told Reuters that Benghazi needed food, medicine, shelter and electricity, although they did not expect the war to stop. In a letter hosted online by conflict mediation group the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue (CHD), they said they wanted to send a message internationally and to the Libyan people. “We, the sons and daughters of Benghazi, protectors of the nation and its unity, coming from diverse backgrounds and sharing the common goal of saving our city and its population, unite behind this humanitarian appeal,” the letter said. Benghazi is one front in a complex conflict in Libya, with rival governments backed by loose armed coalitions. A U.N.-backed unity government is trying to gain traction but faces resistance from hardliners on both sides. After more than a year of street fighting, the Libyan National Army under Khalifa Haftar has made progress against Islamists in Benghazi. Some residents have returned but the security situation remains fractious. “Benghazi is at the heart of the ongoing conflict in Libya. Finding ways to improve the situation there will go a long way to supporting a solution to the conflict at a national level,” the CHD’s Christopher Thornton said. The appeal called for security guarantees for humanitarian workers, rejection of radicalism, and transitional justice. “It’s a humanitarian approach to this problem. A first step,” signatory Abubakr Buera, a House of Representatives member and former negotiator at U.N. talks, said. “I hope that parties to the conflict abide by the appeal and ensure that families caught up in the combat zones can be reached by humanitarian agencies with the necessary supplies,” said Britain’s special envoy to Libya Jonathan Powell, welcoming the “broad range” of signatories. The conflict has killed almost 10,000 people and displaced 50,000 families, according to the Tobruk parliament, east of Benghazi. “It’s a failed city,” activist and signatory, Eman Bugaguis, said.

Sweeping changes that seemed unthinkable just weeks ago have been announced almost daily since a new prime minister, Africa&aposs youngest head of government, took office and vowed to bring months of deadly protests to an end. From the surprise acceptance of a peace agreement with bitter rival Eritrea, to the opening of major state-owned sectors to private investment, plus the release of thousands of prisoners including opposition figures once sentenced to death, the 42-year-old Abiy Ahmed has kept Africa&aposs second most populous country buzzing. ""The people have the full right to criticize its servants, to elect them, and to interrogate them. Government is a servant of the people,"" he said in his inaugural speech in early April. It was unusual talk considering his military background, and he quickly found enthusiastic crowds as he toured the country. Abiy has been called ""Prime Minister Bolt"" for the sprinter-like pace of reforms Some Ethiopians say it&aposs hardly possible to comprehend a single day&aposs events. On Tuesday alone, Parliament kicked off by lifting the state of emergency imposed in response to the protests demanding greater freedoms that began more than two years ago. It marked the most dramatic change yet under Abiy&aposs rule. By nightfall there was bigger news: the prospect of peace with neighboring Eritrea after nearly two decades of border skirmishes and a two-year war. Almost as an afterthought came word that Ethiopia, one of the world&aposs fastest-growing economies, was opening state-owned enterprises in aviation, telecommunications and more to foreign investment or outright privatization. That opens the door for stakes in globally successful Ethiopian Airlines and Africa&aposs largest telecom company by subscribers, Ethio Telecom. ""Now I need to take an umbrella when I get into a shower so that I can grab my phone and follow these rounds of breaking news items,"" joked one Ethiopian, Firew Megersa, on Facebook. The new prime minister has dined with opposition leaders, named new army and intelligence chiefs and suggested that his own position should have term limits. He&aposs visited Saudi Arabia and secured promises that thousands of Ethiopians detained as illegal migrants would be released. He&aposs made new port agreements with neighbors along one of the world&aposs busiest shopping lanes. In a colorful sign of his ambitions, Abiy even hinted that landlocked Ethiopia would revive its navy. Citizens of the East African nation where the government once shut off social media to dampen criticism now find themselves expressing opinions without fear. The return of stability to a key Western security ally in a region with turbulent neighbors like Somalia and South Sudan has some breathing more easily. Despite the whirlwind of change, many wonder just how far reforms can go in a country where the ruling coalition still holds every seat in Parliament and opposition has been punished. ""The language the prime minister is using is very conducive for coming closer, to listen to each other. But for an actual political engagement in the country you need a number of practical things to happen,"" said Andargachew Tsige, an Ethiopia-born Briton and opposition leader who was snatched by Ethiopian intelligence agents in Yemen in 2014 and sent to death row. Andargachew&aposs freedom last month, along with the release of a photo showing him and Abiy in the prime minister&aposs office, captivated many Ethiopians. Despite his turn of fortune, Andargachew told The Associated Press: ""We need to see on-the-ground concrete measures, not only releasing political prisoners, not only making good speeches."" Ethiopia needs independent institutions, he said. While Abiy&aposs rise to power has led to a dramatic decrease in protests, critics say what he has done so far is simply ""putting out fires."" ""Up until now I haven&apost seen any policy direction from the new leader on how to solve Ethiopia&aposs chronic problems, like setting up an equal, competing space for all political parties and directions regarding the country&aposs macro- and microeconomic path,"" said opposition politician Yilikal Getnet. Ethiopia suffers from massive debt and faces an acute foreign exchange crisis after exports fell short of targets. Even the new prime minister&aposs popularity could turn out to be risky in a country with a history of long-ruling authoritarian leaders, Yilikal said. ""I agree his speeches are conciliatory but at the same time I see a tendency of slipping back into dictatorship, with both state and private media delving into creating a cult of personality around the new leader,"" Yilikal said. For now, some observers once alarmed by Ethiopia&aposs unrest have started to soften their tone.

But according to photojournalist Andy Spyra, ""the Chibok girls (are) just the tip of the iceberg; what happened there is what happens on a nearly daily basis."" Spyra has been documenting the return of abducted women in Nigeria, their dangerous journeys and their difficult reintroduction to society. In July, he traveled to Yola, the capital of the northeastern state of Adamawa and the front lines of the government's war against Boko Haram. There, he and reporter Wolfgang Bauer talked with women who had survived the brutality and torture of the Islamic militant group. ""I was moved by the strength of the women ... you would sometimes just listen to their stories and be overwhelmed by it, what they would tell you,"" Spyra said.  When their story was published in Zeit, a German magazine, the journalists also included a call for help: Please help us create a fund to help these women. ""I had this wish to come back and help them in a real concrete way, to come back with something physical in my hands to give back to them,"" Spyra said.  His wish was granted.  The response ""got pretty big,"" Spyra said, and in January they went back to help these women set up bank accounts. Spyra soon found himself on the phone more than behind the camera. Delivering money to these women who live in one of the world's most dangerous areas seemed quixotic at first. But it worked. ""It was all teamwork,"" Spyra said. ""I had a local fixer in Yola who helped identify former Boko Haram victims. The security was tricky even for him. It took some time, at least six months, until he gave us a list of 72 women near the Sambisa Forest."" The women were put on a bus, and every detail was taken care of to avoid attention from potential suicide bombers. The women were even patted down and walked through a metal detector.  ""It was such a sensitive issue for these women,"" Spyra said. ""They had never seen a white man before, and what a cultural gap there was. And at the same time I felt connected to them on a human level, an emotional level.""  But before organizing their finances, Spyra wanted to immortalize their stories through what he knew how to do best. Photographing them this time, however, would be tricky for security reasons. He had to shield them from potential eavesdroppers and avoid attracting attention.  With a piece of black cloth, a few rags and a little chair, Spyra created a makeshift studio at a church compound.  There, one by one, dozens of women would sit in front of the camera and tell their personal stories of survival. ""We heard stories of dead bodies and mass graves, the others in the forest of people who didn't make it,"" Spyra said. ""There were snakes and scorpions, rivers that you had to cross where thousands of women have died in their attempt to flee. These women are really strong and really tough, and how they did it, I don't know."" Spyra said ""in some cases, they escaped during bombardment of Boko Haram-held villages. Some of them scaled fences. Some of them had smart ideas about saying they were going to the market, and they just ran off."" The resulting photo series is an ode to the victims, their forgotten odysseys, their loss of childhood and the difficult road ahead.  Partially lit in natural light and enveloped by a heavy black background like a penumbra, their faces -- especially their eyes -- reflect something they are holding very deep. The economy of lighting emphasizes the scars, the gaze and the discreet expressions of the humanity that has survived so much pain. It is the art of portraiture, something Spyra confessed he knew nothing about. ""I was sweating like hell, not because of the heat in Nigeria, but because I was nervous because I had never had a portrait assignment,"" he said. ""This was my first attempt. ""This is how I could best convey their characters and their personalities. They were radiating, they were strong personalities. I was impressed by their presence after all they had been through, so strong and confident. It really was powerful."" Andy Spyra is a photographer based in Germany. You can follow him on Facebook.

CNN star reporter Jim Acosta is proud that he was kicked out of the Oval Office by President Trump, saying he wears it “as a badge of honor,” while being glorified on ABC for serving as White House antagonist and declaring he welcomes the administration’s hatred. Acosta, who has emerged as a key member of the anti-Trump media, appeared on ABC’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live” on Wednesday night. The liberal late-night host introduced him as “not the most popular journalist in the White House,” before playing a montage of combative moments Acosta has had with Press Secretary Sarah Sanders and other members of the Trump administration. “He is a persistent thorn in the flabby underbelly of the Trump administration,” Kimmel proudly declared before telling Acosta he was “a lot more popular here” than in the White House and it’s safe to say Acosta and the funnyman hit it off. “I love watching you bust their balls,” Kimmel said. “I can’t get enough of it.” Earlier this year,  Trump kicked the CNN star out  of the Oval Office after Acosta badgered the president with racially charged questions. Acosta has made a habit of grandstanding and interrupting when Trump and members of his administration are available to the media. “Are you the only reporter who has ever been kicked out of a press situation by the President of the United States?” Kimmel asked. “I think so. I wear it as a badge of honor. I’m hated by the best people, or the worst people,” Acosta responded. Kimmel then asked a giddy Acosta if he is the administration’s “least favorite” reporter. 'It pays the bills' — Jim Acosta on his antagonism of the Trump administration “Probably,” the CNN star proudly responded. ""As FDR once said, I welcome their hatred.” Acosta then declared that he was “just as tough” on President Obama. “It is funny that your last name is ‘Acosta’ and you’re constantly ‘accosting’ people,” Kimmel said. Last month, the CNN senior White House correspondent was forced to do damage control after he was accused of taking personal shots at Trump supporters, saying “their elevator might not hit all floors.” He defended his comments, claiming that his words were “twisted by some outlets.” “The problem is that people around the country don’t know it’s an act. They’re not in on the act and they take what he says very seriously. They take attacks from Sean Spicer and Sarah Sanders, and what they do to us on a daily basis, very seriously,” Acosta said during an interview with Variety. “They don’t have all their faculties and in some cases their elevator might not hit all floors.” 
      Jimmy Kimmel seated next to Spike Lee, who recently gave an expletive-laden anti-Trump speech at the Cannes Film Festival.
       (Copyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.) While many people assumed Acosta was taking a shot at Trump supporters, he said he was referring to “people who threaten journalists.” Trump has famously dubbed CNN “fake news” and pointed directly at Acosta, calling him by the disparaging moniker in the past. Acosta told Kimmel the moment was “surreal.” Last December, Acosta was shut down by Sanders when he tried to hijack a press briefing. Acosta told Sanders that journalists make “honest mistakes” but that doesn’t make them “fake news” before attempting a question. Sanders quickly cut him off. Acosta has  also gotten into combative arguments  with other members of the administration including Spicer, Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney and Senior Policy Adviser Stephen Miller. Acosta was also slammed this year for shouting questions at President Trump while he was  coloring with young children  at the White House Easter Egg Roll. “I’m enjoying you tormenting them,” Kimmel said as the interview was wrapping up. “It’s a small consolation.” Acosta shot back, “It pays the bills.”",Fox News,Media,132,the liberal latenight host introduced him as not the most popular journalist in the white house before playing a montage of combative moments acosta has had with press secretary sarah sanders and other members of the trump administration.,"{'rouge1': Score(precision=0.9736842105263158, recall=0.05393586005830904, fmeasure=0.10220994475138122), 'rouge2': Score(precision=0.9459459459459459, recall=0.051094890510948905, fmeasure=0.09695290858725762), 'rougeL': Score(precision=0.9736842105263158, recall=0.05393586005830904, fmeasure=0.10220994475138122)}",0.10220994475138122,0.09695290858725762,0.10220994475138122

second chance to thousands of inmates who had no hope of parole. a wiry man with a shaved head a neat mustache and an eager smile morgan was an inmate in a mediumsecurity wing of solano state prison in vacaville calif and he had been preparing for this morning for almost five years setting aside sports and recreation to make time for work prayer study and introspection. there was nothing extraordinary about the case that sent morgan to prison he was a lowranking gang member who had been the gunman in an unsuccessful driveby shooting in 1996. unless the sentence explicitly bans the possibility of parole a lifer in any state can theoretically be paroled after serving some minimum number of years. according to the states board of parole hearings more than 5000 california lifers were eligible to go before a two or threeperson parole panel in 2019 to make the case that they are suitable candidates for release. in the first 11 months of the year 1074 of them or 19 percent were granted parole. while that number is still dwarfed by the tens of thousands left inside its a striking shift from previous decades when fewer than 1 percent of those who went before the board ever returned to society. life sentences usually stem from convictions for violent crimes such as murder rape and kidnapping although by the end of 2016 almost 11000 of the nations lifers had been given those sentences for nonviolent crimes. as a result the number of people serving such sentences  including virtual life sentences that exceed an offenders expected life span  is growing steadily even as the rate of violent crime sinks to its lowest levels in decades. a 2017 report by the sentencing project a criminaljustice researchandadvocacy group found that the number of people serving life sentences nationwide grew by 21000 from 2008 to 2016 driven both by a growth in the imposition of life sentences and by the reluctance of most states to grant parole to those who are eligible. yet lifers are highly unlikely to reoffend once released. a 2011 study by the stanford criminal justice center followed 860 california murderers paroled after 1995 and found that only five  less than 1 percent  went on to commit another felony. this can be explained partly by age people become less likely to commit crimes as they get older. held on prison grounds they can take one hour or last as long as nine hours. while a lifer will have a lawyer present  one who is appointed by the state usually  it is the inmate who will do almost all of the talking responding to detailed questioning by the commissioner and deputy commissioner who conduct the hearing. the modern idea of basing a prisoners release on evidence of his or her rehabilitated character can be traced to 1870 when the inaugural meeting of the newly formed american prison association took place in cincinnati. there representatives from 25 states washington dc and canada adopted a declaration of principles among them that prisoners should be rewarded for good conduct and that a prisoners destiny should be placed measurably in his own hands to achieve this they argued sentences limited only by satisfactory proof of reformation should be substituted for those measured by mere lapse of time by 1922 nearly every state in the union had adopted indeterminate sentencing in which judges hand out sentences that are formulated as a range of years  a minimum and a maximum amount of time to be served. the responsibility for deciding exactly when in this range an inmate had been rehabilitated enough to be released was vested in state parole boards. the federal penal system has its own earlyrelease process. by the 1970s the discretionary parole system was under attack. over time some states got rid of parole entirely while others drastically increased the minimum amount of time an inmate would need to serve before becoming eligible to go before a board. in georgia for example inmates who received a life sentence for a serious crime committed before january 1995 became eligible for parole after seven years. those who have received a life sentence for a crime committed after june 2006 dont become eligible for parole until theyve served 30 years. conducted by panels of political appointees with varying levels of professional expertise little accountability and almost unlimited discretion parole hearings rarely garner attention except when a highprofile inmate comes up for parole. the united states supreme court ruled in 1987 that inmates who have been sent to prison for life have no dueprocess right to be released unless the wording of their states parole statute created one. a 2017 survey of paroling authorities by the robina institute of criminal law and criminal justice at the university of minnesota law school found that 41 percent of parole boards never make public the logic behind a parole denial and at least seven states dont require their parole boards to provide a written explanation for their denial to the paroleseeking inmate. prisoners are often unable to see the file that the parole board bases its decisions on  in alabama and north carolina inmates are not even allowed to be present for the hearing. while every state except kentucky and new mexico allows inmates to have a lawyer at their hearing very few states will pay for one which means only a tiny minority of inmates have a lawyer with them at their hearings. you have about 3 percent of the procedural rights before a parole board as you would in a courtroom says kevin reitz the robina institutes former codirector. thats exactly what happened on march 19 2013 when a parolee evan ebel murdered tom clements the executive director of colorados department of corrections. the parole board has more power over a states prison population than all the judges in that state reitz says.  heres what its going to take to get out on your first day of release eligibility but theres nothing like this in this landscape california is an outlier both because the sheer number of paroleeligible lifers dwarfs those in other states and because a series of lawsuits by california inmates forced the parole board to reform its practices starting in 2008. and thats not a bad thing californias parole process follows a clearly outlined set of procedures that culminate in parole commissioners stating the logic behind their decision at the close of the hearing. inmates have access to the central file that the parole board will be basing its decision on as well as to a stateappointed lawyer like lawrence strauss to help navigate the hearing process. hearing transcripts can be emailed to those who request them and members of the media and the public can apply for permission to attend a hearing. he sat beside strauss on one side of a bank of tables in the prison hearing room an informal chamber with linoleum floors blondwoodpaneled walls and an acoustic tile ceiling. across the table from him was the presiding commissioner robert barton a former deputy district attorney who later served as inspector general of the california department of corrections and rehabilitation. a balding white man with short gray hair deep set eyes and an athletic build he was appointed by jerry brown in 2017. like the boards 16 other fulltime commissioners he spends his days traveling from one prison to another to preside over hearings like this one two per day 49 weeks a year. for each hearing barton and deputy commissioner james martin an administrativelaw judge read hundreds of pages of materials the probation report written narratives submitted by the inmate letters of support from friends and family the complete prison file information about the original crime any appeals and a forensic psychologists risk assessment. while victims and their families are able to attend parole hearings a victim is present at only about 10 percent of them. the victim in morgans case did not attend. the hearing itself would proceed in set stages barton the commissioner would focus on morgans life before he went to prison  the precommitment factors martin the deputy commissioner would ask questions about morgans conduct in prison  the postcommitment factors after that a deputy district attorney from los angeles county where morgans crime took place would be able to ask clarifying questions as would strauss. finally both lawyers and morgan would have a chance to make a closing statement before the commissioners rendered their judgment. and with that the hearing was underway. when morgan was 3 his mother bundled him and his two siblings into a car in the middle of the night and fled ohio for california. the family landed in carson just outside los angeles. for his safety morgan requested that the times not identify his former gang by name. barton slowed the pace of his inquiry. he wanted to know about a robbery that happened in 1989 two weeks before morgan left for the army. and i was at the counter prepared to pay for the beer. morgan never mentioned the arrest to his recruiter. now it was 1992 the war was over and the united states military was rapidly downsizing. morgan says he was given a choice go to military trial and risk a dishonorable discharge or sign the form put in front of him and be discharged honorably. within 90 days he had been arrested for discharging a firearm after shooting at the ground during an altercation between a friend of his and a group of rival gang members. on oct 19 1996 morgan accompanied his pregnant girlfriend to her ultrasound appointment. afterward the couple stopped at the home of one of morgans friends. dozens of men were milling around the street. it turned out that a rival gang had shot two of morgans fellow gang members killing one. one of the leaders of morgans gang asked morgan to go with him to get gas for his new car a cadillac so he could drive back to san diego. but instead of going to the gas station in their own territory the leader drove to one that was claimed by the rival gang. from 15 or 20 feet away he fired three rounds into the hood of a car driven by someone he assumed was a member of the rival gang. after that morgan told the parole board the gun jammed. he and his leader took off pursued by the police. morgan tossed the gun out the window during the chase but they went only about a mile before pulling over and trying  unsuccessfully  to flee on foot. the crime was originally charged as an assault with a deadly weapon then bumped up to attempted firstdegree murder. on the day morgans son was born morgan says the los angeles county prosecutor offered him a 20year plea deal. in july 1997 he was given an indeterminate sentence of 17 years to life which included 10 years for having used a gun. punishment is an oldfashioned word but everyone knows what it means. jerry brown signed a sweeping sentencing bill that expressly eliminated reform and rehabilitation as the goal of california prisons. for every offense there was a menu of three predetermined sentences low medium and high. the only exceptions were for violent crimes like murder rape and kidnapping. these remained subject to indeterminate ranges of years that started with a number and ended with the phrase to life in the ensuing years california voters and legislators would pass hundreds of toughoncrime laws that expanded the states prison population to 163000 in 2006 from around 20000 in 1980. the states 1994 threestrikes law doubled the sentence of an offender convicted of a second felony and gave anyone convicted of a third felony even a nonviolent one a mandatory sentence of 25 years to life. in 2012 the law was changed to apply only to serious or violent felonies. over time lawmakers created a menu of more than 100 sentencing addons that allowed prosecutors to increase the number of years served for a single crime  using a gun having prior convictions

James Morgan in December.Credit...Djeneba Aduayom for The New York Times James Morgan woke up shortly before 4 on the morning of April 19, 2018, and sat on the edge of his bunk, trying to force himself to eat a doughnut. A wiry man with a shaved head, a neat mustache and an eager smile, Morgan was an inmate in a medium-security wing of Solano State Prison in Vacaville, Calif., and he had been preparing for this morning for almost five years, setting aside sports and recreation to make time for work, prayer, study and introspection. Now, sitting in the half-light of his prison dormitory room, he found he could barely swallow. Back when he was 25 and facing a life sentence for attempted murder, he had been too frightened to speak at his trial. But he was 47 now and hoping he would finally find his voice. There was nothing extraordinary about the case that sent Morgan to prison: He was a low-ranking gang member who had been the gunman in an unsuccessful drive-by shooting in 1996. California’s prisons are bursting with black men like him, men whose crimes barely merited a headline. His life story could be rendered in any number of ways — with thug-life bravado, as a wages-of-sin morality tale, as a study in the mechanics of mass incarceration. But in four and a half hours, Morgan would tell his story to the state’s Board of Parole Hearings for the first time, and much would depend on his doing so with insight, self-awareness and candor. “I had never really been honest with authority figures, and I had always feared doing so,” he told me on the phone four days after his hearing. “But deep down inside I knew I should tell the truth, because I had done 22 years, and so I was telling myself, ‘What do I have to fear?’ ” Nearly 40,000 inmates, a third of California’s total prison population, are serving life sentences, a figure greater than the combined total of the next three states with the highest proportions: Florida, New York and Texas. Unless the sentence explicitly bans the possibility of parole, a “lifer” in any state can theoretically be paroled after serving some minimum number of years. But most of the nation’s 162,000 inmates serving life sentences have little hope of ever achieving freedom; that possibility of parole exists almost entirely on paper. For years, this was true in California as well. But over the past decade, the state has begun to inch the gates open. According to the state’s Board of Parole Hearings, more than 5,000 California lifers were eligible to go before a two- or three-person parole panel in 2019 to make the case that they are suitable candidates for release. In the first 11 months of the year, 1,074 of them, or 19 percent, were granted parole. While that number is still dwarfed by the tens of thousands left inside, it’s a striking shift from previous decades, when fewer than 1 percent of those who went before the board ever returned to society. Life sentences usually stem from convictions for violent crimes such as murder, rape and kidnapping, although by the end of 2016 almost 11,000 of the nation’s lifers had been given those sentences for nonviolent crimes. Violent criminals are generally the people the public feels least ambivalent about locking up; life sentences have historically been seen as a humane alternative to the death penalty. As a result, the number of people serving such sentences — including “virtual life sentences” that exceed an offender’s expected life span — is growing steadily, even as the rate of violent crime sinks to its lowest levels in decades. A 2017 report by the Sentencing Project, a criminal-justice research-and-advocacy group, found that the number of people serving life sentences nationwide grew by 21,000 from 2008 to 2016, driven both by a growth in the imposition of life sentences and by the reluctance of most states to grant parole to those who are eligible. Even as politicians from both parties have begun embracing alternatives to mass incarceration, criminal-justice reform has yet to touch those deemed the worst of the worst. “It’s hard to get that people who committed a serious crime are not always potentially on the verge of committing another one,” says Ashley Nellis, a senior research analyst for the Sentencing Project. Yet lifers are highly unlikely to reoffend once released. A 2011 study by the Stanford Criminal Justice Center followed 860 California murderers paroled after 1995 and found that only five — less than 1 percent — went on to commit another felony. None committed another murder. This can be explained partly by age: People become less likely to commit crimes as they get older. But many of those who work with lifers will attest to another factor, something that the American punitive, retributive criminal-justice system scarcely seems to believe is possible: lasting change. Deep in the heart of the largest correctional systems in the country, men and women who have been locked up for decades have improvised a path to rehabilitation using whatever methods they can muster: self-help groups, 12-step programs, books, journal-writing, Bible study, peer mentoring — all of them leading up to the hearing where they must try to win their freedom. California’s parole hearings are something like an ordeal of the soul, an investigation of every stage of an inmate’s life from birth onward. Held on prison grounds, they can take one hour or last as long as nine hours. While a lifer will have a lawyer present — one who is appointed by the state, usually — it is the inmate who will do almost all of the talking, responding to detailed questioning by the commissioner and deputy commissioner who conduct the hearing. “I’m not sure that there are really any other places in life where somebody is scrutinized so much in such a public way by people they don’t know,” says Jennifer Shaffer, the executive officer for the California Board of Parole Hearings. Inmates are expected to show that they understand how they became the person who could commit a terrible crime. As Shaffer puts it: “If you don’t understand the factors that led you to do what you did before, how would anybody know that you’re not going to do it again?” The result is a moral interrogation before interlocutors who can alternate between sympathy and condemnation as they ask inmates to dig deep into the most traumatic episodes of their lives. “That boardroom,” says Lawrence Strauss, the state-appointed lawyer who represented Morgan at his hearing, “is a house of pain.” [Read about the ex-convicts who pick up inmates on the day they are released from prison and help guide them.] The modern idea of basing a prisoner’s release on evidence of his or her rehabilitated character can be traced to 1870, when the inaugural meeting of the newly formed American Prison Association took place in Cincinnati. There, representatives from 25 states, Washington, D.C., and Canada adopted a declaration of principles, among them that prisoners should be rewarded for good conduct and that a “prisoner’s destiny should be placed, measurably, in his own hands.” To achieve this, they argued, “sentences limited only by satisfactory proof of reformation should be substituted for those measured by mere lapse of time.” By 1922, nearly every state in the union had adopted indeterminate sentencing, in which judges hand out sentences that are formulated as a range of years — a minimum and a maximum amount of time to be served. The responsibility for deciding exactly when in this range an inmate had been rehabilitated enough to be released was vested in state parole boards. (The federal penal system has its own early-release process.) Over the next half century, it became clear that there was an intrinsic tension between the high-minded notion that inmates should be in control of their own destinies, by deciding whether or not to reform, and the practical difficulty of determining whether they had actually done so. By the 1970s, the discretionary parole system was under attack. Liberals argued that a parole board’s broad leeway allowed racial and class biases to rule unchecked. Conservatives argued that parole boards were releasing dangerous felons who then went on to commit more crimes. A rising national crime rate made the public increasingly dubious of the paternalistic promises of a rehabilitative system. Over time, some states got rid of parole entirely, while others drastically increased the minimum amount of time an inmate would need to serve before becoming eligible to go before a board. In Georgia, for example, inmates who received a life sentence for a serious crime committed before January 1995 became eligible for parole after seven years. Those who have received a life sentence for a crime committed after June 2006 don’t become eligible for parole until they’ve served 30 years. But discretionary parole continues to exist in most states, even if it’s often limited to a small pool of longtime inmates whose lengthy periods of incarceration have consigned them to near-oblivion. Conducted by panels of political appointees with varying levels of professional expertise, little accountability and almost unlimited discretion, parole hearings rarely garner attention except when a high-profile inmate comes up for parole. The United States Supreme Court ruled in 1987 that inmates who have been sent to prison for life have no due-process right to be released unless the wording of their state’s parole statute created one. In the absence of such rights, parole decisions can be remarkably arbitrary. A 2017 survey of paroling authorities by the Robina Institute of Criminal Law and Criminal Justice at the University of Minnesota Law School found that 41 percent of parole boards never make public the logic behind a parole denial, and at least seven states don’t require their parole boards to provide a written explanation for their denial to the parole-seeking inmate. Prisoners are often unable to see the file that the parole board bases its decisions on — in Alabama and North Carolina, inmates are not even allowed to be present for the hearing. While every state except Kentucky and New Mexico allows inmates to have a lawyer at their hearing, very few states will pay for one, which means only a tiny minority of inmates have a lawyer with them at their hearings. “You have about 3 percent of the procedural rights before a parole board as you would in a courtroom,” says Kevin Reitz, the Robina Institute’s former co-director. All of this makes discretionary parole a far cry from the equation proposed in 1870, in which demonstrated behaviors would result in predictable outcomes. Instead, Reitz has found that parole commissioners are dominated by fears of releasing an inmate who goes on to commit a terrible crime. That’s exactly what happened on March 19, 2013, when a parolee, Evan Ebel, murdered Tom Clements, the executive director of Colorado’s Department of Corrections. When he interviewed parole board members in Colorado, Reitz says, he found the specter of that murder loomed over every decision they made: “Board members told me, ‘If I let someone out and he does something horrible, that’s on me.’ ” So parole-board members have little motivation to release inmates, no matter how deserving they seem. “The parole board has more power over a state’s prison population than all the judges in that state,” Reitz says. “But they have no job security. So they’re extremely vulnerable politically, but they have extreme power over incarceration policy. To me that’s a terrible combination — they live in an atmosphere of fear and risk-aversion.” He favors a system that would significantly diminish parole-board discretion: Prisoners who fulfill certain requirements would be guaranteed early release. “I want to put prisoners in control to some degree of their release date, but I want it to be a true incentive system,” he says. “ ‘Here’s what it’s going to take to get out on your first day of release eligibility.’ But there’s nothing like this.” In this landscape, California is an outlier, both because the sheer number of parole-eligible lifers dwarfs those in other states and because a series of lawsuits by California inmates forced the parole board to reform its practices starting in 2008. “California is definitely on the cutting edge when it comes to due process and legal protections built in through the system, because we’ve had to,” Shaffer says. “And that’s not a bad thing.” California’s parole process follows a clearly outlined set of procedures that culminate in parole commissioners stating the logic behind their decision at the close of the hearing. Inmates have access to the central file that the parole board will be basing its decision on as well as to a state-appointed lawyer like Lawrence Strauss to help navigate the hearing process. Hearing transcripts can be emailed to those who request them, and members of the media and the public can apply for permission to attend a hearing. “Nobody,” Shaffer says, “does parole-suitability hearings like we do.” James Morgan is a slight man who pulses with hummingbird energy. He speaks in a rapid patter, often looping back to correct or expand what he has said, adding bits of reflection and analysis gleaned from his years of participating in, and eventually leading, prison self-help groups. But his restless and voluble nature was barely visible as his parole hearing came to order at 8:35 a.m. on that April day. He sat beside Strauss on one side of a bank of tables in the prison hearing room, an informal chamber with linoleum floors, blond-wood-paneled walls and an acoustic tile ceiling. He was completely still, his prison-issue jeans neatly pressed, a white thermal undershirt covering the gang tattoos scrawled across his arms and torso. His smile made him seem at ease, until you noticed the way he kept clearing his throat and blinking behind his glasses. Across the table from him was the presiding commissioner, Robert Barton, a former deputy district attorney who later served as inspector general of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. A balding white man with short gray hair, deep set eyes and an athletic build, he was appointed by Jerry Brown in 2017. Like the board’s 16 other full-time commissioners, he spends his days traveling from one prison to another to preside over hearings like this one, two per day, 49 weeks a year. For each hearing, Barton and Deputy Commissioner James Martin, an administrative-law judge, read hundreds of pages of materials: the probation report, written narratives submitted by the inmate, letters of support from friends and family, the complete prison file, information about the original crime, any appeals and a forensic psychologist’s risk assessment. While victims and their families are able to attend parole hearings, a victim is present at only about 10 percent of them. The victim in Morgan’s case did not attend. The hearing itself would proceed in set stages: Barton, the commissioner, would focus on Morgan’s life before he went to prison — the “pre-commitment factors.” Martin, the deputy commissioner, would ask questions about Morgan’s conduct in prison — the “post-commitment factors.” After that, a deputy district attorney from Los Angeles County, where Morgan’s crime took place, would be able to ask clarifying questions, as would Strauss. Finally, both lawyers and Morgan would have a chance to make a closing statement before the commissioners rendered their judgment. “What we’re trying to determine here,” Barton told Morgan, “is if you know who you were at the time of the crime, what caused you to commit those crimes, who you are today and whether you’ve changed and, if you have, how did you change, when did you change, why did you change?” Morgan nodded, blinking rapidly. “Yes, sir.” “I show you were born in Ohio,” Barton said. And with that the hearing was underway. Because the commissioners have read so much material in advance, they tend to grill inmates about some topics and skip over things they feel they understand already. Barton moved pretty quickly through Morgan’s early life. His father, a Vietnam vet, was abusive and suffered from violent flashbacks. When Morgan was 3, his mother bundled him and his two siblings into a car in the middle of the night and fled Ohio for California. Morgan and his older sister, DeAqua, both have vivid memories of the night of their escape — hunkering down in the back seat as their father, shouting that he was going to kill them all, bashed in a rear window of the car with a wooden plank, cutting their baby brother’s face. The family landed in Carson, just outside Los Angeles. They moved frequently. Morgan was a sensitive kid, teased by other family members for being a crybaby, but he was a good student, who had ambitions of being a lawyer. Still, local gangs worked hard to recruit him, and at 15 he joined a gang based in his neighborhood that was affiliated with a much larger one. (For his safety, Morgan requested that The Times not identify his former gang by name.) He wasn’t planning on it being a long-term association. In 11th grade, he joined the Army on a delayed-entry program, figuring that would be his ticket to college. Barton slowed the pace of his inquiry. He wanted to know about a robbery that happened in 1989, two weeks before Morgan left for the Army. “It was a going-away party for me, for the going away to the military,” Morgan explained. “So, we went into the store before 2 o’clock so we can buy some more beer to go back and drink. And I was at the counter, prepared to pay for the beer. And everybody began to run out. And, me being the follower that I was, and growing up in the neighborhood, when one person runs, everybody follows suit. And so, I definitely ran out of the store with them, sir.” “O.K.,” Barton said. “So, it was a beer run.” It was hard to judge his tone. He seemed almost unimpressed by an incident that for Morgan was one of the key moments in his life. “And this is basically where,” Morgan continued, his words coming faster now, “my mind and everything changed about me.” After he served as a combat engineer with a tanker battalion in Kuwait, after he returned to a base in Germany, after he met and married a student at the University of Munich who was the daughter of two Army officers, “I was called in and told that I had lied on my enlistment form.” He had been arrested the night of the beer run and charged with misdemeanor theft of the beer. He went to court on his 18th birthday, where his mother pleaded with the judge to be lenient, given that he had never been arrested before and was about to serve his country in Operation Desert Storm. After praising Morgan for enlisting, the judge let Morgan go. Morgan never mentioned the arrest to his recruiter. Now it was 1992, the war was over and the United States military was rapidly downsizing. Morgan says he was given a choice: go to military trial and risk a dishonorable discharge or sign the form put in front of him and be discharged honorably. He signed. “So, did you go right back to the gang?” Barton asked. His expression was neutral. Morgan nodded. “Yes, I did.” “Why?” “At the time, I had a belief that I was a failure, and I was, basically, scared to go out and try again,” Morgan said, talking rapidly. “I took a victim’s stance about life,” he continued. “My life wasn’t going to go anywhere because I ruined an absolutely great chance that I had to live a good lifestyle — you know, the things that I had experienced in Germany and Kuwait were just my dream. And I had destroyed it on my own. And I just couldn’t deal with the way I felt about it.” When Morgan returned to California, he and his wife moved in with an old friend of his from the neighborhood. Soon it was as if he’d never left. He was out on the corners, selling crack, just like everybody else. Barton wanted to know how Morgan, who had spent three years in the military without breaking the law, could return to a life of crime as soon as he got back. This, he said, was “problematic.” “Did you just not care about the difference between right and wrong?” he pressed. “No,” Morgan said. “That wasn’t it. What it was was just the effect of coming home and seeing where my life was at, as a result of my own decisions.” Morgan remembers his wife, a white woman from Minnesota, hating the lifestyle they returned to. Ultimately she decided she herself would enlist; that way, they could return to Germany together. But once his wife left for basic training, the life she and Morgan had envisioned seemed like a mirage. “The type of life I’m living, it just seems like that’s like a fantasy,” Morgan recalls. The exigencies of gang life felt far more real. Within 90 days, he had been arrested for discharging a firearm after shooting at the ground during an altercation between a friend of his and a group of rival gang members. After that, he figures he was free for maybe 16 months in four years. Although still married, he started a relationship with another woman, who quickly became pregnant. “O.K.,” Barton said. “So the military didn’t change you. Prison sentences didn’t change you, right? I mean, I’m looking at the opportunities you had to be deterred from all the crime.” He was pushing now, almost goading. He seemed determined to portray Morgan as a man who had lots of choices and opted for the worst ones time after time. Morgan didn’t push back. “I had many opportunities,” he agreed. “Yes, sir.” He had been told by other inmates that if he gave a good answer, his interlocutors would move on; if he didn’t, they would dig in. Barton moved on. “I was keeping a little tally in my head,” Morgan said later. “It’s amazing how the mind works when you’re fighting for your life.” Eventually, Barton steered the conversation to what is called “the life crime” — the crime that led to Morgan’s life sentence. On Oct. 19, 1996, Morgan accompanied his pregnant girlfriend to her ultrasound appointment. Afterward, the couple stopped at the home of one of Morgan’s friends. Dozens of men were milling around the street. The mood was tense. It turned out that a rival gang had shot two of Morgan’s fellow gang members, killing one. One of the leaders of Morgan’s gang asked Morgan to go with him to get gas for his new car, a Cadillac, so he could drive back to San Diego. But instead of going to the gas station in their own territory, the leader drove to one that was claimed by the rival gang. “Do you have a gun?” the leader asked Morgan as they approached. Morgan did. From 15 or 20 feet away he fired three rounds into the hood of a car driven by someone he assumed was a member of the rival gang. (He wasn’t.) The bullets didn’t hit anyone. After that, Morgan told the parole board, the gun jammed. He and his leader took off, pursued by the police. Morgan tossed the gun out the window during the chase, but they went only about a mile before pulling over and trying — unsuccessfully — to flee on foot. The crime was originally charged as an assault with a deadly weapon, then bumped up to attempted first-degree murder. On the day Morgan’s son was born, Morgan says the Los Angeles County prosecutor offered him a 20-year plea deal. Morgan, 25 years old at the time, asked if it could be reduced to 15 so he could get out in time for his son’s teenage years. The district attorney held firm. Morgan went to trial. “What I wanted to do was get up there and talk and try to figure out a way to show them that what I did was an assault instead of attempted murder,” he told me. “But I didn’t have the courage to take the stand. I stepped back and watched the whole three-day process just go right before my eyes without making a sound.” The jury found him guilty. In July 1997, he was given an indeterminate sentence of 17 years to life, which included 10 years for having used a gun. His co-defendant, also given a life sentence, broke down sobbing in the holding cell, but Morgan refused to react, certain that if he allowed himself to cry, he might never stop. “My mom always used to say, ‘It’s too late for you to cry now,’ ” he told me. “ ‘Now you have to pay the punishment.’ ” [The ex-convict who became an attorney.] “Punishment” is an old-fashioned word, but everyone knows what it means. “Rehabilitation,” on the other hand, is considerably harder to define. A 1981 article by Louis R. Lopez in Golden Gate University Law Review argued that failing to release a prisoner until he had been “rehabilitated” was itself “reprehensible” and “cruel,” because the therapies available in prison ranged from ineffective (psychoanalysis) to sadistic (medication, lobotomies and solitary confinement). “If human knowledge were developed to the point where all but the most incorrigible offenders could be rehabilitated in due time, such a system would work marvelously and would surely meet with the approval of all,” Lopez wrote. Absent such knowledge, prisoners were caught inside a paradox: They couldn’t leave until rehabilitated, but the system had no reliable method for rehabilitating them. In 1976, Gov. Jerry Brown signed a sweeping sentencing bill that expressly eliminated reform and rehabilitation as the goal of California prisons. The purpose of incarceration was punishment, the law said, full stop. For every offense, there was a menu of three predetermined sentences: low, medium and high. The only exceptions were for violent crimes like murder, rape and kidnapping. These remained subject to indeterminate ranges of years that started with a number and ended with the phrase “to life.” In the ensuing years, California voters and legislators would pass hundreds of tough-on-crime laws that expanded the state’s prison population to 163,000 in 2006 from around 20,000 in 1980. The state’s 1994 three-strikes law doubled the sentence of an offender convicted of a second felony and gave anyone convicted of a third felony, even a nonviolent one, a mandatory sentence of 25 years to life. (In 2012, the law was changed to apply only to serious or violent felonies.) Over time, lawmakers created a menu of more than 100 sentencing add-ons that allowed prosecutors to increase the number of years served for a single crime — using a gun, having prior convictions, gang affiliation. A system that no longer even tried to rehabilitate inmates helped fuel the belief that rehabilitation was impossible. After a paroled felon kidnapped and murdered a 12-year-old girl named Polly Klaas in Petaluma, Calif., in 1993, parole all but disappeared. On the rare occasion that the board awarded parole, its decision was almost always reversed by the governor. (In 1988, voters gave the governor authority to “affirm, modify or reverse” parole decisions for inmates convicted of homicide.) By 1999, a lifer’s chance of receiving parole was well below 1 percent. The effect on prisons was stark. Researchers at the University of California, Irvine, found that in the decade between 1991 and 2001, inmate-on-inmate violence increased nearly fivefold, largely because of the increased power and prevalence of prison gangs. Many facilities went on almost permanent lockdown, with inmates confined to their cells 23 hours a day. With no hope of ever getting out, inmates threw themselves into smuggling operations, petty rivalries and retaliatory violence. This was the world in which Morgan found himself in 1997 when he arrived at Salinas Valley State Prison, a maximum-security facility. “There was this fatalistic outlook on things,” he recalls. “Everybody was just stabbing each other and fighting the staff and rioting on the yard — hundreds of guys all fighting and stabbing each other.” But Morgan kept his optimism, despite the fact that there was little basis for it. “I was in the wrong life,” he says. “I was there because my plan for the next step had backfired. So I always told myself, ‘I’m going to get out.’ ” At the same time, he couldn’t imagine surviving prison without the gang relationships that had put him there. “I threw myself in with both feet,” he says. “People in there prey on the weak, the timid, the undecided, so I put on the mask and marched forward.” That meant doing whatever the gang demanded. In 1998, he stabbed another inmate multiple times at his gang’s behest. (The victim survived, despite multiple cuts and a puncture wound to the chest.) In 2001, he was caught carrying a shank and had 36 months added to his sentence. In 2011, when an old friend got into a chow-hall fight over a payment for drugs, Morgan started to walk away, then made a U-turn and joined in the riot. That action got him sent into solitary for seven months. In 2008, the California Supreme Court ruled that neither the governor nor the parole board could use a crime’s heinousness as the sole justification for denying parole to someone serving a life sentence. Instead, the central question was whether an inmate continued to pose a risk to public safety. Three years later, the United States Supreme Court ruled that California’s overcrowded prisons were in violation of the Eighth Amendment’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment and ordered the inmate population be reduced to 137.5 percent of the system’s capacity. That was the year Jerry Brown became governor for the second time, returning to the office he left in 1983. During his first two terms, Brown presided over the switch from a rehabilitation-oriented prison system to one focused on punishment. Now he would preside over the reversal of his reversal. In 2013, Brown signed SB260, which created a special parole process for inmates who committed their crimes before age 18 but were charged as adults. Over subsequent years, the Legislature raised the cutoff age to 23 and finally 26, reflecting research that has found that the prefrontal cortex, which governs the executive functions of impulse control, decision-making and the understanding of consequences, isn’t fully developed until around the age of 25. (Morgan, who committed the crime that led to his life sentence when he was 25, therefore came to be reclassified as a youth offender.) “It’s called hope,” Brown told The Los Angeles Times shortly before leaving office in December 2018. “One hundred fifty thousand young men with zero hope bolsters the gangs, leads to despair, leads to violence and makes the prisons very dangerous. Many of them, the majority, will get out anyway. And they’ll get out as very wounded human beings.” In October 2012, Morgan was transferred to Solano State Prison. The facility has a wealth of self-improvement programs and a culture that supports taking advantage of them. Almost immediately, other lifers approached him to talk about what they called “recovery.” They told him about Criminals and Gang Members Anonymous, an inmate-led group that approached gang membership like an addiction. “Just come and sit, and if you don’t like it, you can leave,” he remembers them saying. So he went, largely because he wanted the “chronos” — the chronological entries in an inmate’s central file documenting participation in self-help programs. Parole commissioners typically ask about chronos in hearings. “And then of course you go to that first group and you feel like every question is aimed at you,” Morgan told me. “It was like going to the doctor and finally finding out what you have.” At one of the early meetings he attended, another inmate challenged him about the love Morgan professed for his son, whom he wrote weekly letters to but had never met. (He and the son’s mother stayed together for a few years, but Morgan stopped calling her after she married another man.) As he tried to explain why his son wasn’t in his life, Morgan found himself weeping. “That’s how badly I felt about the truth he was telling me, which is that I really didn’t love my son until I was ready to be a man and take a step back from these activities,” he says. But the old impulses were hard to overcome, even as Morgan got a job in the prison’s optical-lens shop and became more deeply committed to his Christian faith. In 2014 he once again jumped into a fight, this time during a nighttime melee in his dorm. “That was a relapse,” he told the parole board. Instead of using the skills he’d learned in his groups, he explained, “I acted completely on an old belief.” That belief, he said, was based in fear: He had known that a conflict was brewing and had gone to bed with his boots on, worried that he would be attacked while he slept. Barton showed little sympathy for this explanation. “You could have backed up instead of going forward,” he noted. “I didn’t,” Morgan agreed. Then he made one more attempt to explain himself: “I definitely acted in fear and acted under that belief.” That riot would be Morgan’s last. After 35 days in solitary, he went to his gang’s shot-caller and told him he wanted out. “I have to change my life,” he remembers thinking. “I can’t keep doing this to myself.” His wasn’t an unusual request, particularly in a lower-security prison like Solano, which has fewer active gang members. “You kind of age out,” Morgan explains. “My peers in our 40s, we don’t walk around with our chests stuck out no more — that’s for younger guys.” The shot-caller told Morgan he’d seen him going to groups, doing what inmates call “programming,” and had no problem with him leaving the gang as long as he “minded his business” by staying on the straight-and-narrow path. Morgan joined another self-help group called Gang Affiliates Transitioning to Excellence. Its participants, all former gang members, pushed him to peel away his defenses. One day they told him how they saw him: arrogant, standoffish, still cloaked in gangster swagger. “I didn’t show the real James to many people at all because that would be opening myself up to abuse,” he says. “The person I really am is someone who’d share, talk about feelings, who’s just nice. The reason I put on the mask in the first place is because the streets felt too dangerous for James, too scary.” But eventually he trusted the others with his deepest shame — the fact that he was a bed wetter as a child and frequently beaten for it. He had imagined how the label could be used, how humiliated he would be, but at the same time he felt that this childhood trauma explained so much about his later need for validation and acceptance. When he went before the board, he was disappointed that Barton never provided him with an opportunity to talk about the bed-wetting; the thing he feared talking about was also the thing he yearned to discuss. “It’s healing,” he told me. “It’s healing to tell your story.” That’s the underlying premise of California’s parole process, which is intensely narrative. It rewards those who can make sense out of senselessness, connecting the dots between childhood troubles and adult crimes. Incarcerated people have often lived their lives in broken sequences — their sense of cause and effect dislocated by chaos and discord, trauma, addiction, mental illness and long stretches of incarceration. Yet the parole board demands explanations: why you were selling drugs, why you were using drugs, why you got in that car, why you were carrying a gun, why you thought those things were O.K. Those explanations are seen as a kind of inoculation against future misdeeds: If you understand it, you can prevent it from happening again. Victor L. Shammas, a Norwegian sociologist who has written about California’s parole process, is skeptical of this emphasis on what he describes as the capacity to “produce linguistic utterances in a socially legitimate form,” an ability that he notes is highly correlated to class, education and mental health. And indeed, the board’s emphasis on insight as a predictor of future dangerousness isn’t grounded in science. “I’m not aware of any studies that show that insight and remorse are correlated to recidivism,” says Heidi Rummel, the director of the Post-Conviction Justice Project at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law, a clinical program in which law students advocate for the rights of prisoners. “I think it just makes everyone in the room feel better.” The parole board and the various prison self-help programs prize personal responsibility above nearly all other virtues. Past traumas are simply shaping forces that lead to, in the idiom of self-help, “defects of character” that cause criminality. Making excuses or playing down the impact of your crimes is seen as a sign that an inmate is still thinking like a criminal, still under the sway of those same character defects. As part of a restorative-justice program in Oakland, Calif., that brings together formerly incarcerated people with never-incarcerated ones for weekly conversations, I once told a group of former lifers a story from my own childhood in which I described following the lead of an elementary-school friend in bullying one of our classmates. When I finished, a man who had done 40 years before being paroled spoke up. “I noticed you said you were following your friend,” he said. “You’re not taking responsibility for what you did. You’re still making excuses.” Taking responsibility for your past is a way of asserting that you have the power to write a better story in the future, that you can control the destructive impulses that led to your incarceration in the first place. But when looking at your past through a lens of personal responsibility, what do you do with the social forces you had no control over: a military that was quick to dispose of you when you were no longer useful; a district attorney’s office with a reputation for overzealous prosecution; a nation with a history of discrimination and inequality; a prison system filled with men of color? Psychological insight had changed Morgan’s life, and he rarely told a story without shading in the emotional details, elucidating how his inner wounds had led him to harm others. But sometimes, when he looked back on the crime that sent him to prison with a life sentence, he couldn’t help pointing out that when he fired into the car at the gas station in 1996, he hadn’t actually hit anyone. “I mean, of course I’m guilty,” he told me. “I did wrong. I used a handgun in a careless manner. But at the same time, I don’t believe I was trying to kill anybody. My thought was to be seen in the eyes of my homeboys as somebody who’s down for this type of lifestyle. But at 15 feet away, all three bullets went into the hood of the car. I was in the military. I know how to shoot a firearm.” Then he stopped himself. “I don’t want to be seen as rationalizing and justifying. Just sometimes, sometimes it’s hard to let go of everything, to swallow it down and just be mature about it.” [From The 1619 Project: Why American Prisons Owe Their Cruelty to Slavery.] Most state-appointed lawyers, like Lawrence Strauss, meet with their clients just once before their hearings; Strauss told me he typically does eight consultations in a single day. He was paid a total of $400 for representing Morgan, a fee that covered the initial consultation, the hearing itself and the time spent reviewing Morgan’s central prison file, which ran to several hundred pages. Private lawyers can help clients prepare for their hearings, but very few inmates can afford one. So lifers typically turn to other inmates for help; most long-term inmates have been before the board multiple times. They tend to speak of commissioners the way athletes speak of rivals whose game tapes they’ve studied. Former lifers told me that the commissioners watch your body language; that they analyze your sentence structure, alert to passive constructions like “I caught my case” instead of “I committed my crime”; that they push you to see if they can get you to “show your canines.” Those who have experience going before the board share information and anecdotes, coaching one another on how to handle difficult questions and reading over transcripts of past hearings. There are also a few law clinics, like Rummel’s, or nonprofits that offer pro bono assistance with the parole process. Uncommon Law, run by Keith Wattley, a lawyer in Oakland, has helped secure the release of about 240 inmates, 60 percent of the total they’ve represented. The firm’s lawyers and law students spend months, and sometimes years, helping their clients prepare for their hearings, even bringing in their own counselors to help deal with emotional issues that can’t be addressed through the available self-help groups. They spend hours talking with clients about their lives, assign them reading and writing homework and even conduct mock hearings. But, Wattley says, parole-board hearings are too unpredictable for any rote recitation to be effective — the insights have to be genuine and personal to work. “We help our clients understand and articulate their own arc of transformation,” he says. “When they can do that, it doesn’t matter what the question is that the board is asking. They can handle it.” Wattley’s point was one I heard from many. Winning a parole date is usually the reason inmates start the process of self-discovery, but once the process of self-analysis begins, it stops being about the board. “Nobody ever says, ‘I wish I hadn’t done all that work on myself because I didn’t get a date,’ ” Rummel says. But what about those who are never able to articulate their “arc of transformation”? Is lifelong incarceration the appropriate remedy? In May 2018, I sat in on the parole hearing of a 51-year-old man named Johnny Smith, who had done 31 years on a 15-years-to-life sentence for second-degree murder. The case, like Morgan’s, revolved around a shooting, this one between two neighborhood gangs in Oakland in 1987. In Smith’s case, someone was killed — a 68-year-old good Samaritan named Terry Brown, who came out of his house to help a wounded gang member and was shot in the neck. Smith didn’t fire that fatal shot — his gun had jammed and he was running away through a vacant lot — but under the legal doctrine known as the felony-murder rule, his participation in the shootout made him just as responsible for the murder as the person who did fire. Smith, a baldheaded black man with a short, graying beard and a nose that looks as if it had been broken more than once, worked as a cook in San Quentin prison. He hadn’t had a serious disciplinary violation in two decades but was denied parole in each of his eight hearings since becoming eligible in 1996, receiving three-year denials each time. (Every parole denial comes with a prescribed length of time — three, five, seven, 10 or 15 years — before the inmate is allowed to try again.) Inmates can petition to have their hearing dates moved up; his most recent hearing was just a year and a half earlier. Since then, he had studied the transcript carefully, highlighting the parts that told him what he needed to do to increase his chances of parole. He had to participate in self-help groups that focused especially on three things: gangs, overcoming criminal thinking and the suffering of crime victims. The commissioners, he felt, were trying to help him. “I know exactly what she was trying to tell me,” he said, referring to the commissioner who presided over his last hearing. “She’s trying to make sure that I don’t go out there and fall into the hands of the same people that I dealt with when I came here, which is understandable.” Smith had gone to some of the recommended groups, but he hadn’t taken to them the way Morgan had. He wasn’t particularly introspective by nature, and he had trouble presenting a board-friendly narrative of his life or remembering the definition of jargony self-help words like “prosocial.” In conversation, he tended to skitter away from the traumatic events that might have explained how he wound up committing crimes — the best friend who was killed by a speeding car right in front of him when he was 5, his father’s absence, his stepfather’s emotional abuse of his mother, the varsity football career that ended when he got hit by a car in high school. “The way I was brought up, some things you just don’t speak on,” he told me. He preferred to talk about other matters: his plans for the future with his grown daughter and 9-year-old granddaughter and goddaughter; his ignorance of the basics of the modern world after so long in prison (he didn’t know, he confessed, how to use a microwave oven); the old friends who were law-abiding citizens now. The story he had to tell was straightforward: He’d been a hardheaded young man once, but he had been a model inmate for more than two decades. Now he hoped to return to his old neighborhoods and talk to youngsters who were as hardheaded as he used to be. “I want to go back out there,” he said. “I want to help bring my community back up.” Neither his good intentions nor his clean prison record were enough to get him a parole date, however. “I’m getting denied for what we consider as being little things — you know, insight, you’re not showing remorse,” he told me over the phone shortly before his ninth parole hearing. Those “little things,” of course, were the very things the parole board considered paramount, but a lot of the board’s preoccupations seemed illogical to Smith. It had taken him a long time to understand why the authorities considered his group of associates to be a gang — a word he associated with large criminal organizations — or why he would be guilty of murder when the victim was shot by someone else. He said he thought about Terry Brown’s murder every day, but it was hard to access his feelings sometimes, particularly in the hearing room. Each time he went before the board, Smith ended up tongue-tied and inarticulate. But was that indicative of the future danger he posed to the public? “The parole process is like threading a needle — the people who have come out through the parole board are extraordinary people,” says Rummel, who has represented hundreds of lifers in their parole hearings. “We could swing the door a little wider. They don’t have to be A-plus human beings. They could be B-plus human beings.” Smith’s ninth parole hearing was on May 9, 2018. He sat at a table with his state-appointed lawyer, Marc Gardner, his back to a window whose vertical blinds, wavering in the breeze, offered tantalizing glimpses of the sparkling San Francisco Bay. His feet tapped nervously beneath the table. The presiding commissioner, Patricia Cassady, pressed him for explanations, just as previous commissioners had: Why had he been a bully in school? Why had he liked fighting? Why did he join a gang? Smith’s answers were short and uninformative. He spoke with his forehead furrowed, his expression pained and puzzled, as the commissioners guided him through various episodes of childhood delinquency — stealing bikes, cutting school — until they arrived at the crime he was incarcerated for, the botched attempt at a revenge killing of a rival gang member. Smith’s crew had been trying to sneak up on the apartment where the man was hiding out, but Smith, who said he didn’t know much about firearms, had accidentally fired his weapon into the ground, triggering the shootout. Brown was hospitalized for 15 months before he died. Two of the men who were in the gun battle ended up testifying for the prosecution, but Smith refused to testify against his friends. If he had, Patrick Reardon, the deputy commissioner, noted, “You do a year,” maybe less. Instead, he had done 31 so far. Yet he insisted he would make the same decision today. “I didn’t want to be a snitch,” he said. “So, if you saw or you knew about a plot inside prison to hurt a correctional officer, you wouldn’t tell the authorities?” Cassady asked. “No,” Smith said. “I mean, I have to be honest with myself, no.” “So, are you the same guy today that you were when you came to prison in 1989?” Reardon asked. “No. No, sir, I’m not.” “It sounds like you are.” “I believe not.” Smith’s final statement was simple and heartfelt. “Mr. Brown did not have to lose his life on my stupidity, but he did, and I can’t say anything other than I’m sorry for what happened to him. And I can’t take back what happened to him, but what I can do is make myself better by better understanding my actions — and this is what I’m trying to do. I know I still have a little work in myself, and I understand that,” he said. “And if this is what it takes for me to gain my freedom, this is what I have to do. And that’s what I’m going to work on.” The decision was unsurprising — a three-year denial. His mother, Sonya Caldwell Smith, told me that her son was tearful when he called to tell her the news, but when he called me, a few days after the decision, he insisted he was fine. “To be honest, I messed that up,” he said. “I get nervous for some apparent reason because I’m so caught up in trying to get up out of here. I’m not taking my time to actually say what it is that needs to be said, and that’s what I need to start doing. See how calm I am talking to you? I need to be like that when I’m talking to them,” he added, “because that’s what’s going to free me.” He was still mulling over the hypothetical situation Cassady posed that had tripped him up. “What she said is true,” he said. “She said, ‘You still have the same criminal way of thinking.’ It’s true, I do. I can’t blame nobody for that.” Smith has since been transferred to a minimum-security prison. His next parole hearing is scheduled for May 2021. By the second hour of Morgan’s parole hearing, the questions came faster and faster. Barton wanted to know about the crimes Morgan had been caught for and the ones he hadn’t, both in and out of prison. Why did you do these things? Why didn’t you stop sooner? Why did you stop when you did? Was there an epiphany? Whom do you hang out with now that you’ve left your gang behind? Then he posed a hypothetical similar to the one Cassady had posed to Smith. “Tomorrow you walk by a couple of guys. You overhear them talking. And they’re talking about putting somebody in check, maybe stabbing them.” “Yes, sir.” “What do you do?” “I’m going to mind my business and keep walking,” Morgan said, with the confidence of a man who knows the right answer on a test. “That’s all you’re going to do?” Barton asked incredulously. “You wouldn’t do anything to stop it or let people know?” There was a brief pause. “To be honest, sir, considering my safety, I definitely would not take part in any of those activities,” Morgan replied. Barton seemed dismayed. “Given the fact that you involved yourself in criminal activities that have harmed so many people, you don’t feel that there’s any moral obligation on your part to perhaps prevent someone else from getting hurt, if you could?” “Yes, sir,” Morgan said. “And you said you believe in God.” “Yes, sir.” “But you wouldn’t do it?” Morgan took a deep breath. “I believe I have to develop the strength to be able to do that, sir. I lived my life in prison 22 years with obeying the way things go and living in fear of standing against these people. One day I may be strong enough to do that, but I’m going to be honest with you. Today I gave you my honest answer.” Later he couldn’t believe what he said. He believed in being honest, but at the same time, the object was to get out of prison. “If I would have had some time to think about it, maybe I might have lied,” he admitted. “But that’s what came out.” By the time he gave his closing statement, Morgan looked as if he’d aged 10 years. His face was drawn and sad; his hands shook. “Today I sit before you repentant and ashamed of the sick shell of a person I was back then,” he told the board, reading from a handwritten piece of binder paper. “Today I can see everything with compassion. This has allowed me to understand why I became a person who embraced lawlessness and disregard of human life.” Tears ran down his cheeks. “I am sorry that my foul behavior required each of you to have to spend time and resources to deal with me.” He wiped his eyes as he quoted Psalm 25: Remember not the sins of my youth and my rebellious ways, according to your love remember me for you are good, O Lord. Waiting for the verdict, Strauss predicted a three-year denial. Parole grants are rare at a first hearing, Strauss says, and Morgan’s last disciplinary violations were only a few years behind him — mere minutes in lifer time. Morgan was taken back to the holding cell while the commissioners deliberated. There, he discussed his hearing with another inmate who had a few parole denials under his belt. The inmate made the same prediction as Strauss: You’ll probably get a three. Unwilling to accept this, Morgan slid over to the far side of the bench and began to pray: Lord, you can trust me with this date. I’m not going to do anything bad that could get me in this position again. When the hearing reconvened, he was back at the table, his eyes red. When Barton said the words “eligible for parole,” Morgan wasn’t sure he had heard correctly. It was only when Strauss grabbed his hand and shook it that he understood he was going home. Paroled inmates are not released right away. There’s a 120-day period in which parole grants are reviewed administratively, and then another 30-day period in which they’re reviewed by the governor. So it wasn’t until that August that correctional officers drove Morgan through the prison gates. He had looked like an old man the last time I’d seen him, but when I met him in downtown San Francisco a few days later, he was dressed like a teenager, wearing long shorts and skate shoes, a Vans baseball cap, a baseball-style sweatshirt and a large cross. His stride was loping, his head swiveling as he took in the crowded intersection with wonder, commenting on the styles (“Why does everybody wear their clothes so tight?”) and the way people stared at their phones while waiting to cross the street (“All these people, they really don’t interact”). He was already thinking about what jobs he might get — he’d heard you could make $22 an hour washing dishes. In prison, he earned $100 a month. “I could make that in five hours? I will jump on that!” he said as he walked to the V.A. so he could register for benefits. He had so much to do: identification to get, relationships to repair, a grown son to meet. Standing on the corner of 16th and Mission Streets, he did a slow-motion 360. “It’s just like a dream,” he said. “There’s so much to look at.” Over the next year, Morgan tried his hand at construction, dishwashing, catering and bus driving, socking away savings as he tried to figure out what line of work was sustainable for a man his age. He reconnected with the mother of his son, who was now divorced. After several long phone calls, she drove from Los Angeles to San Francisco to see him. Despite the years of separation and the anger she felt about being left on her own with a newborn baby, the pair still had chemistry. After so many years of being around men who hid their feelings, Morgan was sometimes overwhelmed by his girlfriend’s emotions, but he knew this was part of the process of putting his family back together. “This is what women go through when we make these decisions as young men and we abandon these people,” he said. “There’s going to be some blowback.” This August, his parole officer gave him permission to move back to Los Angeles, where he’d lined up a job doing leak detection and repair at an oil refinery. Morgan took the mother of his son to a Zales jewelry store and put down a deposit on two wedding rings. Getting to know his 22-year-old son has been a slower process. Morgan says he can feel the young man’s wariness. They work out together, do boxing drills, bond through sports. In those moments, Morgan stifles his urge to pour out his heart, to offer advice about how to be a man without a mask. “I can’t push and shove because he’s a man, so I have to figure out how to be useful to him,” he said. For now, he saves his advice for the young men he meets at work or on the basketball court, men whose romance with tough talk and guns remind him of his younger self. His prison history is a source of curiosity to them, and so he paints himself as a cautionary tale. “I tell them I didn’t kill anybody but I shot at somebody,” he says. “I tell them I still got punished because society is sick of people getting hurt and they have to make an example.” The explanation doesn’t quite contain the complexity of his feelings about his life sentence. But it’s the only one he has.",The New York Times,magazine,3780,according to the states board of parole hearings more than 5000 california lifers were eligible to go before a two or threeperson parole panel in 2019 to make the case that they are suitable candidates for release. a 2017 report by the sentencing project a criminaljustice researchandadvocacy group found that the number of people serving life sentences nationwide grew by 21000 from 2008 to 2016 driven both by a growth in the imposition of life sentences and by the reluctance of most states to grant parole to those who are eligible. a 2011 study by the stanford criminal justice center followed 860 california prisoners paroled after 1995 and found that only five less than percent went on to commit another felony. while a lifer will have a lawyer present one who is appointed by the state usually it is the inmate who will do almost all of the talking responding to detailed questioning by the commissioner and deputy commissioner who conduct the hearing. the modern idea of basing a prisoners release on their character and conduct is based on the idea that the more time they spend in prison the more likely they are to reoffend. the modern idea of basing a prisoners release on their character and conduct is based on the idea that the more time they spend in prison the more likely they are to reoffend. the modern idea of basing a prisoners release on their character and conduct is based on the idea that the more time they spend in prison the more likely they are to reoffend. the modern idea of basing a prisoners release on their character and conduct is based on the idea that the more time they are more likely to reoffend. the modern idea is based on the idea that the idea that the idea is based on the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea. the idea..,"{'rouge1': Score(precision=0.8601036269430051, recall=0.032793362307388385, fmeasure=0.0631779257849667), 'rouge2': Score(precision=0.4831168831168831, recall=0.01837399980243011, fmeasure=0.035401598781880476), 'rougeL': Score(precision=0.7746113989637305, recall=0.029533781114184116, fmeasure=0.056898192197906754)}",0.0631779257849667,0.035401598781880476,0.056898192197906754

pedestrian-friendly streets. Jane Jacobs told you so! The Scajaquada Expressway looms over the Delaware Park in Buffalo, but maybe not for long.CreditCreditShane Lavalette for The New York Times BUFFALO — The Scajaquada Corridor is a city dweller’s dreamland, a culture-vulture Valhalla. Within two miles there is a restored Frank Lloyd Wright house you can visit, an art museum with Picassos and Gauguins, three college campuses, a zoo and a history museum in a majestic Greek Revival building from the 1901 Pan Am Exposition listed on the National Historic Register. All of it borders a 356-acre park designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux. There is just one problem: An expressway runs through it. The Scajaquada Expressway, or Route 198, is a 3.2-mile tear in the urban fabric. Built in the early 1960s, it slices Delaware Park in half, isolates north Buffalo from destinations south, makes walking or bicycling in the area a death-courting activity and creates the strange optical illusions common to freewayscapes. The Albright-Knox Art Gallery and the Buffalo History Museum are less than half a mile apart, on opposite sides of the Scajaquada. Looking across the expanse of pavement and speeding traffic, however, the distance seems insurmountable. “People don’t cross the Scajaquada,” said Alison Merner, the communications coordinator for GObike Buffalo, who grew up in a neighborhood that borders the expressway. “If I were going to go for a run or a short bike ride, I would always stay on my side. You were kind of on an island.” The Scajaquada is not just a local barrier but also a poster road for a growing movement being championed by progressives in the urban-planning community. They want to tear down some highways in cities and replace all that elevated-and-barricaded pavement with lower-speed streets that favor pedestrians and bicyclists and foster greater connectivity among neighborhoods and residents. It’s the kind of argument you can imagine the journalist and activist Jane Jacobs making, and indeed she led a successful campaign against Robert Moses in the 1960s to block a planned expressway through Lower Manhattan before it could be built. The highway would have resulted in the demolition of wide swaths of Greenwich Village and SoHo. One of the groups leading the new charge is Congress for the New Urbanism. Since 2008, it has published a biennial list called “Freeways Without Futures,” which names highways whose elimination would, according to its website, “remove a blight” from their cities. The 2017 edition includes Route 710 in Pasadena, Calif., Interstate 70 in Denver, Interstate 375 in Detroit and, paved enemy No. 1, the Scajaquada Expressway. Lynn Richards, the president and chief executive officer of C.N.U., said that removing a highway is “a somewhat radical idea.” “There’s a lot of analysis that needs to go into it about where the traffic is going to go,” she said. But already, several cities have removed or decommissioned existing highways, including Paris; Seoul, South Korea; Boston; and Portland, Ore. Last year, Rochester buried a portion of a downtown expressway known as the Inner Loop, a stretch of sunken highway the city’s mayor likened to a “moat.” It is being replaced with a boulevard on the same grade as the rest of the streetscape. And because of a confluence of factors, including the embrace of ride-hailing services like Uber and the rebirth of cities as places to live, work, raise families and retire to, advocates like Ms. Richards see an “incredible opportunity” to remove even more pavement. “When we put out a call last summer for freeways without a future, we got almost 75 recommendations,” she said. “This can kick-start a conversation about the best way to spend infrastructure dollars.” Many in-city highways were built during the post-World War II boom years with easy money from the 1956 Federal-Aid Highway Act. They hail from an age when the automobile was ascendant and were built to quickly move commuters in and out of urban centers; many of these highways were used by white suburbanites and built in low-income minority neighborhoods (“white men’s roads through black men’s homes,” went a saying in Washington). Perhaps the greatest argument that removal advocates have is that so much of this infrastructure is nearing the end of its life span. In this era of tight budgets and political gridlock, it may be cheaper for local and state governments to remove a freeway rather than repair or build a new one. If it sounds counterintuitive, if not crazy, to tear down a highway that still carries thousands of cars and trucks each day, there are a number of case studies to point to. One of the earliest and, to advocates, most successful, was San Francisco’s double-decker Embarcadero Freeway. It skirted the city’s waterfront and was demolished instead of rebuilt after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. “The Embarcadero came out of the waterfront, and now the waterfront real estate is seeing tremendous value,” said Peter Park, a city planner in favor of removing highways in cities where neighborhoods have been “significantly disconnected.” Not only in San Francisco but also in every case where a highway has been removed, Mr. Park argues, “the city has improved.” Mr. Park was the planning director for Milwaukee when the city decommissioned the Park East Freeway spur in 2002. Less than a mile long, the highway hosted traffic snarls each day, but it had its supporters, especially among suburban commuters and truck drivers, and there was concern about what would happen if it was removed. “The basic argument for it was, people will never get to the city without it,” said John Norquist, Milwaukee’s mayor at the time, who spearheaded the removal campaign. “Well, how do they get to Paris? The arguments were left over from this glorious age of motoring after World War II.” The bill to demolish the Park East and restore the street grid was around $30 million, significantly less than the $80 to $100 million estimated cost to rebuild the 40-year-old freeway, Mr. Norquist said. He pointed to the rising land values and the slow-but-steady development along the 26-acre corridor in the years since — and the lack of a traffic apocalypse — as signs of success. Mr. Norquist, who went on to run Congress for the New Urbanism for a decade and is now a semiretired consultant, said removing a highway is not just about addressing local residents’ concerns. “We had to make the big argument, the Jane Jacobs argument, that the freeway was harmful to the whole city,” he said. Since the mid-1980s, civic groups in Buffalo have been arguing for the decommission of the Scajaquada Expressway. After more than a decade of environmental impact studies, and after a car traveling the expressway struck and killed a child in 2015, the state is now responding. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has earmarked nearly $100 million for a project that will convert a 2.2-mile portion into a lower-speed boulevard; organizers hope to start construction in 2018. “What we envision going to would be more of an urban boulevard that allows all modes of transportation — pedestrians, bicyclists and cars — to use that facility,” said Angelo Trichilo, deputy chief engineer for the New York State Transportation Department. Still, some argue that the department’s current plan, which eliminates features like merged lanes and uses seven new traffic lights and a raised median with curbs to slow cars, doesn’t go far enough to reduce the expressway’s impact or image and fails to look at the redesign in an innovative way. “It’s like lipstick on a pig,” said Stephanie Crockatt, executive director of the Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy. “They have a lot of pretty drawings, but they’re not fixing anything. The road will be just as wide. There will still be a slab of pavement. We’re still not seeing the connectivity and sensitivity.” In the conservancy’s office cottage inside Delaware Park, Ms. Crockatt and her colleagues showed a color rendering of their own “vision for the new Buffalo.” Most notably, their plan calls for an Olmsted-designed stone arch bridge, presently used by cars and as retained in the state’s proposal, to be returned to its pedestrians and bicyclist origin — in essence, to replace pavement with grass and knit back together the park’s two halves in a way that visually reduces car traffic. They also want to remove the median and scale back the footprint of eight-lane intersections. In response, Mr. Trichilo said the agency has held “over 50 meetings” with stakeholders and the public “to build consensus that we can all agree to” — though opinions diverge widely from keeping the expressway to downsizing to a two-lane road. The Transportation Department considered the conservancy’s plan to eliminate traffic on the stone bridge. But based on its study, a new intersection would be required, and that intersection “just could not handle the traffic,” Mr. Trichilo said, adding that the Federal Highway Administration has concurred. For supporters of the conservancy’s plan, including Justin Booth, the executive director of GObike Buffalo, the makeover of the Scajaquada offers a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to “restore Olmsted’s original vision,” as Mr. Booth put it. He was referring to the network of graceful boulevards the landscape architect designed to connect Buffalo’s parks, many of which have since been converted to freeways. Buffalo could become a leader in forward-thinking urban design and a cultural tourist destination, advocates say. And the Scajaquada Corridor redesign could serve as a model for how to approach other highway tear-downs, including the plan to demolish the Robert Moses-built Sheridan Expressway in the Bronx. “That’s why it’s so important to get it right now, and not finance a mistake into perpetuity,” Mr. Booth said. But even at a time when cities are embracing bike-sharing programs and mass transit; even when the end of the car (or the human driver anyway) is speculated; even when waterfronts and industrial and low-income areas where in-city highways were built are being reclaimed through gentrification — it’s not easy to tear down a hunk of concrete in place for generations. At a Transportation Department public presentation meeting last year, Ms. Crockatt learned that for some, the 19th-century Delaware Park is the problem, not the ’60s-era expressway.

sports doctor Larry Nassar in the worst sex-abuse case in sports history, officials announced Wednesday. The deal surpasses the $100 million-plus paid by Penn State University to settle claims by at least 35 people who accused assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky of sexual abuse, though the Nassar agreement involves far more victims. Michigan State was accused of ignoring or dismissing complaints about Nassar, some as far back as the 1990s. The school had insisted that no one covered up assaults, although Nassar&aposs boss was later charged with failing to properly supervise him and committing his own sexual misconduct. ""We are truly sorry to all the survivors and their families for what they have been through, and we admire the courage it has taken to tell their stories,"" said Brian Breslin, chairman of Michigan State&aposs governing board. ""We recognize the need for change on our campus and in our community around sexual assault awareness and prevention."" It is not clear how much each victim will receive, although the money will not be divided equally. It is also unclear where the money will come from. University spokeswoman Emily Guerrant said school leaders will now work on a way to pay the bill. Rachael Denhollander of Louisville, Kentucky, who in 2016 was the first woman to publicly identify herself as a victim, said the agreement ""reflects the incredible damage which took place on MSU&aposs campus."" But she said she still has not seen any ""meaningful reform"" at the university. Nassar treated campus athletes and scores of young gymnasts at his Michigan State office, building an international reputation while working at the same time for USA Gymnastics, which trains Olympians. The university and lawyers for 332 victims announced the deal after negotiating privately with the help of a mediator. Under the agreement, $425 million will be paid to current claimants and $75 million will be set aside for any future claims. Lawyers will also be compensated out of the $500 million pool. Nassar, 54, pleaded guilty to molesting women and girls under the guise of treatment and was caught with child pornography. He is serving three prison sentences that will likely keep him locked up for life. More than 250 women and girls gave statements in court when Nassar was sentenced in January and February. Since that time, even more accusers have stepped forward, which accounts for the larger number of people covered by the Michigan State agreement. Nassar&aposs assaults were mostly committed in Michigan at his Lansing-area home, campus clinic and area gyms. But his accusers also said he molested them at a gymnastics-training ranch in Texas and at national and international competitions. Nassar&aposs work far away from campus was spelled out in his employment contract with Michigan State. During the sentencing hearings, many accusers described an ultra-competitive gymnastics culture in which authority figures could not be questioned and Nassar was free to abuse young patients year after year. They said they had little choice to see doctors other than Nassar, who was renowned throughout the sport. He counted on his charm and reputation to deflect any questions. He was so brazen that he sometimes molested patients in front of their parents, shielding the young girls with his body or a sheet. His clinic was decorated with signed photos of Olympic stars, bolstering his credentials to star-struck athletes and their families. Olympic gold medalists Jordyn Wieber, Aly Raisman, Gabby Douglas and McKayla Maroney say they were among Nassar&aposs victims. Other cases involved participants in soccer, figure skating, rowing, softball, cheerleading, wrestling, diving, dance, and track and field. ""This historic settlement came about through the bravery of more than 300 women and girls who had the courage to stand up and refuse to be silenced,"" said John Manly, the lead attorney for the victims. The scandal rocked Michigan State, leading to the resignation of President Lou Anna Simon on Jan. 24 and athletic director Mark Hollis two days later. The fallout has also pushed out many leaders at the top of competitive gymnastics. The school has about 39,000 undergraduate students. Its general fund budget is $1.36 billion. Roughly $983 million comes from tuition and fees, and $281 million is from the state. The settlement applies only to Michigan State. Lawsuits are still pending against Indianapolis-based USA Gymnastics, the U.S. Olympic Committee and an elite gymnastics club in the Lansing-area. Under the deal, the victims are required to withdraw their support for two bills passed by the state Senate. They would strip an immunity defense in sexual misconduct civil cases if public entities are negligent and waive minors from legal notice requirements in such lawsuits, Manly said. Other measures that would retroactively extend the time limit to sue and expand and strengthen Michigan&aposs mandatory reporter law remain alive in the House. ___ White reported from Detroit.",Fox News,CRIME,653,lansing mich michigan state university agreed to pay 500 million to settle claims from more than 300 women and girls who said they were assaulted by sports doctor larry nassar in the worst sexabuse case in sports history officials announced wednesday. the deal surpasses the 100 millionplus paid by penn state university to settle claims by at least 35 people who accused assistant football coach jerry sandusky of sexual abuse though the nassar agreement involves far more victims.,"{'rouge1': Score(precision=0.9743589743589743, recall=0.09004739336492891, fmeasure=0.1648590021691974), 'rouge2': Score(precision=0.948051948051948, recall=0.08659549228944247, fmeasure=0.15869565217391302), 'rougeL': Score(precision=0.9743589743589743, recall=0.09004739336492891, fmeasure=0.1648590021691974)}",0.1648590021691974,0.15869565217391302,0.1648590021691974

Racism.” “Unbelievable,” steamed Beto O’Rourke. “That’s not what happened,” wrote Kirsten Gillibrand. “Lives literally depend on you doing better,” Cory Booker tweeted.  New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet said senior editors quickly recognized problems with the original headline Monday night and rewrote it. “The fact that Beto O’Rourke and Cory Booker didn’t like it didn’t influence me,” Baquet said in an interview Tuesday. “I don’t need the entire political field to tell me we wrote a bad headline. It was evident.”  Still, the furious response capped an outpouring of frustration lately from 2020 candidates, Democratic strategists and left-leaning columnists over everything from CNN’s handling of last week’s primary debate to coverage of race and white supremacists to the years-old gripe that news organizations are too willing to amplify Trump’s words. O’Rourke channeled that discontent best Sunday with an exasperated reaction to a reporter’s question about what Trump could do in response to the deaths of 22 people in El Paso at the hands of a suspected white nationalist. “He’s been calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals,” O’Rourke responded. “Members of the press, what the fuck?” Neera Tanden, the president of the left-leaning think tank Center for American Progress, told POLITICO that O’Rourke “spoke for millions of liberals” with those three words.  “If you’re thinking, ‘Can Trump make this better?’ you’re absolving him of his role in this, and it makes people think you don’t get it,” Tanden said.  Democrats and progressives expressed some frustration with the media in 2016, claiming that journalists neglected Sen. Bernie Sanders early on and that they were obsessed with Hillary Clinton’s emails. And Democrats are quick to distinguish their critique of the news media from that of the right, especially Trump’s attacks on journalists as “the enemy of the people.” O’Rourke, for one, has told crowds that the media is not the “enemy,” and nearly every Democratic campaign has vowed to bring back White House press briefings if elected. Still, the critique of the news media is cropping up more as the 2020 presidential campaign heats up, including during the primary debates hosted by CNN. And it has the potential to hurt the news business’ reputation with a large chunk of the electorate, just as Republican voters became less inclined to trust the mainstream media after years of candidates decrying what they viewed as liberal bias.  “A vast swath of Democratic voters are pretty angry at the media,” said Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior Obama adviser who is now a “Pod Save America” co-host. “They see a racist liar in the White House and a media too afraid to call him a racist or a liar. They see a media obsessed with Trump voters who like his rhetoric and little interest in those targeted by his rhetoric. I think Beto's comments spoke to a feeling that media as currently constructed is not up to the moment we are living in."" Pfeiffer said he sees the progressive critique as one “made in good faith and with the desire that the press does its job better.” Still, he acknowledges a shift in how his party is pushing back and said candidates on the left can use that media criticism to rally support.  “For the first time in my career, making the press a foil is good politics in a Democratic primary, and that is going to have long-standing consequences for the business of journalism,” he said.  In recent election cycles, Republican candidates, including Newt Gingrich in 2012 and Trump in 2016, battled debate moderators over their questions — whipping up their supporters in the process. In last week’s Democratic debate, Sanders bristled at being asked to respond to what he called “Republican talking points” on Medicare for All, at one point suggesting to moderator Jake Tapper that TV networks such as CNN are beholden to health-care industry advertisers. “Is this a Fox News debate?” Sanders’ national press secretary Briahna Joy Gray asked on Twitter. “These right wing questions my god.”  CNN also faced criticism for setting up confrontations between the candidates onstage over their past statements or differences on policy. Journalists said the network was trying to highlight distinctions between the candidates, but many Democrats thought the moderators went too far. “The media is adapting to the Trumpification of politics by making debates wrestling matches between candidates instead of a discussion of ideas,” Tanden said. Sanders has long railed against the “corporate media” for its coverage of both the country and his presidential campaigns. While none of the other 2020 campaigns have gone so far as to question mainstream organizations’ ownership or motives— with the exception of Fox News, which some candidates have boycotted — several campaigns aren’t shy about publicly criticizing the media and urging supporters to do the same. Ian Sams, national press secretary for Sen. Kamala Harris, has frequently used Twitter to push back on coverage he thinks is unfair, and he told POLITICO campaigns have no choice but to do that.  “We live in a media ecosystem where things move so fast that you often don't have the luxury of the tools you once did,” Sams said. “When stories go live and within minutes are amplified to millions of people online, the system doesn't always allow dialing up the reporter, getting in touch with their editor, and hoping for a correction. By the time that happens, the original content could have thousands of retweets.” Brian Fallon, who served as deputy press secretary for Clinton’s 2016 campaign and is now executive director of progressive organization Demand Justice, told POLITICO on Monday afternoon that “a lot of Democrats are understandably exasperated about the broken state of the media in the age of Trump.” “Instead of the media standing up against his lies, we get thought pieces about whether the truth really matters anymore,” he continued. “Instead of calling out Trump's racism, we see headline writers engaged in acrobatics designed to achieve some false measure of objectivity.” On Monday night, Fallon was one of the prominent progressive critics to pounce on the Times’s initial headline choice about Trump’s press conference on the shootings. Editor Baquet ""cares more about being seen as impartial by diehard supporters of Donald Trump than he does about faithfully representing what is happening in American politics,” Fallon tweeted.  In an interview with POLITICO, Baquet said what he called the “bad headline” occurred because the copy editor who wrote it had “too few words to capture the breadth of the report.” The headline was a banner that had to wrap together a news story and a separate analysis piece. “We gave him too little room, and he wrote what was essentially a news headline,” Baquet said. “I know people want to read something larger in that, and I get it,” said Baquet, who acknowledged being “in the business of reading larger things into events.” But Baquet pushed back on suggestions that the headline reflects broader issues with the Times's coverage of Trump.  “I’m going to argue that we have done deep investigative reporting about Donald Trump,” he said. “I’m going to argue that we have done a lot of stories about Donald Trump and race. I am going to argue that we have done the most detailed reporting about Donald Trump’s finances. I’m going to argue that our coverage has been pretty rigorous and tough about Donald Trump and the administration.”  Baquet said he believes news organizations like the Times, The Washington Post and others “have risen to the occasion.” Some liberal Times subscribers, however, disagree. The hashtag #CancelNYT was trending Tuesday morning. Adam Jentleson, who served as deputy chief of staff to former Sen. Harry Reid, said on Twitter that he was going to do just that.  “I resisted for a long time but I’m cancelling my NYT subscription today,” he tweeted. “Great reporters but terrible editorial judgment on headlines and social media, which is all most people read. It can’t be the paper of record anymore if it doesn’t accurately report the news.” CORRECTION:  An earlier version of this story misspelled Newt Gingrich.",Politico,,386,pfeiffer said he sees the progressive critique as one made in good faith and with the desire that the press does its job better still he acknowledges a shift in how his party is pushing back and said candidates on the left can use that media criticism to rally support.,"{'rouge1': Score(precision=1.0, recall=0.03494060097833683, fmeasure=0.0675219446320054), 'rouge2': Score(precision=1.0, recall=0.03426573426573427, fmeasure=0.0662609871534821), 'rougeL': Score(precision=1.0, recall=0.03494060097833683, fmeasure=0.0675219446320054)}",0.0675219446320054,0.0662609871534821,0.0675219446320054

Orsino and Marcel Anthony Martino were married Sept. 28 at Lambs Hill, a mountainside events space in Beacon, N.Y. The Rev. Dr. Robert White, a Presbyterian minister, performed the ceremony. The bride, who is 55 and taking her husband’s name, is a vice president in Sugar Loaf, N.Y., for the Citizens Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving quality of life in the community. She graduated from the State University of New York at Purchase. She is the daughter of Christa M. Orsino of Maybrook, N.Y., and the late James J. Orsino Sr. The bride’s father retired as a yard master for the New York, New Haven, Hartford Railroad. Her mother was a stay-at-home parent. The groom, 69, is a chief executive officer in Hamptonburgh, N.Y., for Inspire-Orange County Cerebral Palsy Association. He graduated from Manhattan College and received an M.B.A. from Wagner College. He is a son of Paula M. Martino of Beacon, and the late John Martino, who lived in Florence, S.C. The groom’s mother retired as an office manager at Studio Legali Bisconti, a law firm in New York. His father was a professor of languages at Francis Marion University in Florence, S.C. The bride and groom’s first two marriages ended in divorce. The couple met in May 1993 when Mr. Martino served as an interim administrator at Julia L. Butterfield Memorial Hospital in Cold Spring, N.Y., where Ms. Orsino worked as an administrative manager, recruiting and credentialing physicians. “He was so handsome and kind,” she said. “We developed a strong friendship rooted in mutual respect and admiration.” At that point, Ms. Orsino and Mr. Martino were both married with children — she had a 2-year-old daughter and he a 5-year-old son and infant daughter. Although they had not yet turned a romantic corner, there was an undeniable attraction. “I saw her as this beautiful woman who was also very smart, loyal and respectful,” Mr. Martino said. “I enjoyed seeing her every morning.” Five months later, Mr. Martino’s interim role ended, and though he departed, they kept in touch. In 1995, Ms. Orsino’s first marriage ended in divorce, as did Mr. Martino’s second marriage. He called her later that same year to ask her on a date, but learned that she was already in a committed relationship. “I was certainly disappointed,” Mr. Martino said. “She was someone I knew who would be really good for me, but the timing just wasn’t right.” They remained friends. “When life went sideways here and there,” Ms. Orsino said, “Marcel seemed to always be there to offer friendship and a steady, guiding hand.” He was there in 2000, when Ms. Orsino, then living in Mahopac, N.Y., was seeking employment. Mr. Martino, then the chief executive of a physical, occupational and speech therapy company in White Plains, hired Ms. Orsino as the company’s director of marketing. She worked there for a year and a half, and they again went their separate ways. In 2009, Ms. Orsino’s second marriage ended in divorce, and a year later she moved to Manhattan, where she was working in pharmaceutical sales, and eventually lost contact with Mr. Martino. In October 2015, Ms. Orsino moved back to Maybrook, N.Y., where she grew up, and was now just a 20-minute car ride from Mr. Martino, who was living in Newburgh, N.Y. Unaware of what Mr. Martino was doing with his life, Ms. Orsino emailed him, and he responded immediately, suggesting they meet for dinner. As they broke bread together on a first date that Ms. Orsino described as “calm, comfortable and familiar,” Mr. Martino told her that he was now single — and that the timing was finally right for them to get together. “I couldn’t believe he was still available,” Ms. Orsino said. “At first I was afraid to jump into another relationship, but this time, things were so easy. There was no drama, and he was so sweet and understanding and made me his top priority, and I haven’t opened a door for myself since.” An earlier version of this article misidentified the location of Francis Marion University.

Pelosi, who criticized President Donald Trump on Friday for not coming to Congress beforehand, reiterated her call for the White House to provide a full briefing to lawmakers of the fatal drone strike and the U.S.'s potentially deeper involvement in the region.   “This initiation of hostilities was taken without an Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) against Iran, without the consultation of the Congress and without the articulation of a clear and legitimate strategy to either the Congress or the public,” she added.

He hasn’t provided notice,” Murphy tweeted Friday. “Next, he will go to war with Iran without an authorization if Congress doesn’t take drastic steps to force him into compliance.”   The White House, as required under the 1973 War Powers Act, notified Congress on Saturday of its military activities that killed the leader of Iran’s elite paramilitary forces at Baghdad airport on Thursday.

The high court on Monday found that the Colorado Civil Rights Commission failed to adequately consider Jack Phillips&apos religious beliefs when it ruled against him for refusing to make the cake at his Masterpiece Cakeshop. Without explicitly citing the case, Republicans who control the state Senate tried to add more pro-business seats on the commission — one of the first such panels in the nation — when it came up for reauthorization during the 2018 legislative session. In the end, lawmakers changed the composition of the seven-member commission to add a business representative and, among other things, ensure no political party has an advantage on the panel. The agreement also confirmed Senate authority to reject gubernatorial appointments to the commission, whose mandate was extended until 2027. ""For me, the Masterpiece case was a symptom of the problem of imbalance in the commission,"" said Bob Gardner, a Colorado Springs Republican senator who negotiated a renewal. ""We avoided steadfastly injecting this case into the debate simply because it was such a lightning rod."" Senate President Kevin Grantham said the Supreme Court decision opens the door to follow-up reforms. But Gardner noted that November&aposs elections — which could keep the governor&aposs office in Democratic hands and give Democrats both chambers of the Legislature — also will play a major role in its fate. ""We have an election, and the governor we elect this November will make the next three appointments,"" Gardner said. Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Polis hopes to become the first openly gay governor in Colorado. He has three competitors in a June 26 primary to choose a GOP candidate in the race to replace Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper, who is term-limited. ""We can and must provide LGBTQ people with abundantly clear protections from discrimination in law,"" Polis said after the Supreme Court ruling. In their 7-2 ruling, the justices found that Colorado&aposs commission violated Phillips&apos First Amendment rights when it ruled in favor of Charlie Craig and Dave Mullins. The court said some commission members used speech exhibiting anti-religion bias in their deliberations. Justice Anthony Kennedy, who wrote the majority opinion, said anti-discrimination laws ""must be applied in a manner that is neutral toward religion.""

claims show Iran's ""deterrence power"" but the United States suspects violated a U.N. resolution. According to state news, Iran's Revolutionary Guard said Tuesday's missile tests exhibit Iran's ""full readiness to confront all kinds of threats against the Revolution, establishment and territorial integrity."" The United States, however, believes ""there are strong indications (this) test is inconsistent with U.N. Security Council 2231,"" State Department spokesman Mark Toner said. ""If confirmed, we intend to raise the matter in the U.N. Security Council,"" Toner added. ""We will also encourage a serious review of the incident and press for an appropriate response."" A senior official in President Barack Obama's administration later referenced a ""medium-range missile"" -- not the long-range variety alluded to in Iranian official news reports -- and added that the Security Council ""could take action to investigate the matter, engage Iran and condemn the launch."" The United States could act on its own, as well. But there's been no suggestion this launch will scuttle or in any significant way affect the international community's landmark deal with Iran over its nuclear program. Iran claims missiles OK, wouldn't carry nukes Tuesday's report from Iran's state-run Press TV characterized the firing of missiles from ""silo-based launchers"" around Iran as ""the final stage of large-scale missile drills."" It also referenced a test last October of a new precision-guided, long-range missile known as the Emad -- a liquid-propelled rocket with a 1,050-mile (1,700-kilometer) range -- which would put it within reach of longtime Iranian nemeses Israel and Saudi Arabia. The developing technology has stirred fears Iran could fit the missiles with nuclear warheads, weaponry that Tehran insists it does not possess.  Yet, according to Press TV, Defense Minister Hossein Dehqan has stated the Emad missile is a conventional weapon. And Foreign Minister Javad Zarif -- while defending Iran's right to carry out missile tests -- has insisted the country doesn't have any missiles that could carry nuclear warheads. Still, there's hardly a guarantee that skeptical rivals will accept Iran's assurances that its military ""poses no threat to other countries,"" as Press TV claimed. Just look back to what happened last fall, when Iran's missile tests spurred the U.S. Treasury Department's to levy sanctions against ""11 entities and individuals involvement in procurement on behalf of Iran's ballistic missile program.""   Focus on missiles distinct from nuclear deal Ironically, that announcement happened around the same time that broader, international sanctions related to Tehran's nuclear program were lifted -- a move widely seen as a sign of Iran becoming more open and less adversarial with others around the world, including countries in the West. Tuesday's missile test would not violate the agreement on Iran's nuclear program known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, Obama administration officials said. Thus, it wouldn't mean that deal falls apart and sanctions specific to it are reinstituted.  Still, Tehran could face significant repercussions because of Tuesday's missile test. The U.S. government ""continue(s) to work closely with partners around the world to slow and degrade Iran's missile program,"" said Toner, the State Department spokesman.  These include measures like the sanctions imposed in January and U.N. Security Council ""prohibitions ... to disrupt missile-related proliferation networks worldwide,"" according to Toner. The senior Obama administration official vowed to ""continue to vigorously enforce the key elements of Resolution 2231 that prohibit all other (countries) from transferring missile technology and expertise to Iran.""

Last week, data from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found that the 11-month deficit had surpassed $1 trillion, but it was expected to fall back under that threshold after an expected spike in tax payments in September. The Treasury data, however, offered no such assurances, estimating that the fiscal year would close $69 billion above the $1 trillion mark. The growing deficit, which adds to the nation’s debt burden, raises concerns about the nation’s fiscal health. Interest on the debt has cost the U.S. $379 billion this year, more than spending on veterans benefits, education and transportation. “Absent more responsible budgets, the deficit and interest costs will continue to grow rapidly, diminishing America’s future. The longer we wait, the more costly and difficult it will be to put our nation on a stronger path,” said Michael Peterson, CEO of the fiscally conservative Peterson Foundation. The CBO has called the nation’s fiscal path “unsustainable,” warning that it may make it more difficult to combat future recessions and could potentially set up a financial crisis down the road. The main drivers of the deficit are mandatory spending programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, though recent tax cuts and increases to discretionary spending have also widened the spending gap.

Iran is a notorious violator of human rights and promoter of sectarianism. In 2015, nearly 700 at least were executed in Iran. Mr. Zarif calls Saudi Arabia’s execution method barbaric, but he serves a regime that orders lashing of teenage rape victims before executing them. The Islamic Republic divides its citizens between “insiders” and “outsiders.” The outsiders are those who reject the idea that the theocrats are viceroys of God on earth. Given the cruel treatment of its outsider citizens, it is absurd for Mr. Zarif to suggest that his government is against “destabilizing extremism.” The Saudi regime is corrupt and worse than medieval in the treatment of its dissidents, but it rules a country that wants to preserve the status quo in the Middle East. Iran’s theocrats are as corrupt and intolerant as their Saudi counterparts, but they also want to export their revolution to Arab countries and thus seek to destabilize the region through subversion and propaganda as well as military and economic assistance to Shiite militias in Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Lebanon.

offers a glimmer of stability for the Obamacare insurance markets. But for it to become law, each party will need to declare a victory — and President Donald Trump will have to agree to prop up a law he just spent months trying to repeal. For Democrats, the deal negotiated by Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.) would restore key subsidies that Trump cut off just days ago. For Republicans, it would offer states flexibility to approve health insurance plans that would have the lower premiums they’ve promised voters. The framework, which got immediate support from more Democrats than Republicans, will need the lobbying muscle of the White House to win over skeptical Republicans in Congress. The president’s initial supportive statements in the Rose Garden and in phone calls to Alexander “are helpful because we need his support,” Alexander told reporters. “His recognizing that, in his words, he doesn’t want people to be hurt over the next two years while we’re still debating the long-term consequences of health care, that’s very helpful.” Trump on Tuesday — despite having abruptly axed the Obamacare cost-sharing subsidies on Oct. 12 and repeatedly declared Obamacare ""dead"" — praised the idea of Congress restoring the payments as “a very good solution.” The president called it a “short-term solution so that we don't have this very dangerous little period — including dangerous periods for insurance companies, by the way.” But late on Tuesday in an appearance at The Heritage Foundation, Trump further muddied his position. “While I commend the bipartisan work done by Sens. Alexander and Murray — and I do commend it — I continue to believe Congress must find a solution to the Obamacare mess instead of providing bailouts to insurance companies,"" he said. But getting the deal through would require a sustained, focused lobbying effort on Capitol Hill, where Republicans are facing a biting political calculus. They’re still stinging from spending all of this year in a draining but fruitless effort to repeal and replace Obamacare — the law that congressional Republicans have been trying to uproot for seven years. Now, they would have to decide whether the state flexibility concessions Alexander got are enough. “Clearly it'd be helpful for President Trump to be on board” to win over conservatives, said a GOP senator. “I would think President Trump would find this appealing not as a solution — no one's selling it as a solution — but as a short-term measure to avoid over the next year and a half having continued instability in the marketplace."" That senator, like many fellow Republicans, was reluctant to stake out a position, having only heard the broad-strokes outline from Alexander in a closed-door lunch meeting. House Republicans, who earlier this year approved an Obamacare repeal bill only to be left hung out to dry by the Senate, are even more skeptical. “The GOP should focus on repealing & replacing Obamacare, not trying to save it. This bailout is unacceptable,” conservative Republican Study Committee Chairman Mark Walker said. ""Obamacare is in a 'death spiral.' Anything propping it up is only saving what Republicans promised to dismantle.” Conservative groups aren’t giving the deal any air cover to restore the subsidies, which cover out-of-pocket medical bills for low-income people. The insurers legally have to make those payments, whether the government keeps the subsidies flowing or not. The uncertainty over the subsidies is why some insurers fled the Obamacare markets — and those that stayed raised premiums to cover the costs. The Heritage Foundation said funding the cost-sharing program would “prop up the subsidized Obamacare exchange market but would do absolutely nothing to stabilize” the broader market. “What is instead needed to stabilize the unsubsidized market is the removal of Obamacare’s cost increasing insurance mandates and misguided regulations,” said Ed Haislmaier, a health policy expert at The Heritage Foundation. ""Obamacare doesn't need a lifeline,"" Club for Growth spokesperson Rachael Slobodien emailed POLITICO. ""Its cord needs to be pulled."" Freedom Partners also pushed back hard, urging conservatives in Congress to insist that any compromise include an elimination of Obamacare's individual and employer mandates. But Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), who has worked with Alexander to whip up support, expressed confidence that Trump could persuade skeptical Republicans to fall in line. ""The fact that the president has indicated a real interest in seeing a bipartisan fix like this move forward for a short-term fix is critical,"" Rounds said. ""If the White House said, 'Look, we're not interested in it,' then I don't think we'd be able to go anyplace with it."" Democrats on Tuesday were eager to hear more. They have a much lower political risk to signing on: They want to see the health care law succeed and would love for Republicans to have more political ownership of the law and the 2018 premium rates. As part of the deal to reinstate the subsidies, Democrats agreed that states could allow a new catastrophic health plan — a so-called copper plan along with the more generous gold, silver and bronze — that would cost less but still include the basic package of Obamacare benefits. The clock is ticking. Alexander and Murray are trying to enact a bill that could have an effect on 2018 premiums, the vast majority of which have already been set by insurance companies and approved by states. The lawmakers say they’re trying to add into the bill assurances that savings would have to be passed on to consumers but have not yet released details. Alexander said Tuesday that he’d like to have a “significant” number of Republican and Democratic co-sponsors by the end of this week. From there, he says, he wants to hand off the legislation to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to figure out how to enact it. Alexander knows he has his work cut out for him. Throughout weeks of negotiations, he has repeatedly said that he would only push forward a plan that he believes could get “significant” bipartisan support, including concessions designed to appeal to his party's more ardent Obamacare opponents. A summary of the proposal circulated Tuesday appeared aimed at accomplishing just that, emphasizing that the deal would cut premiums, shift power to the states and avoid adding a penny to the deficit. It included a warning: If Republicans don't act now, the resulting chaos will provide a ""four-lane highway"" for Democrats to speed toward single-payer health care. If Alexander can get enough Republican support, a stand-alone bill seems unlikely, in part because some Republicans are fearful of tying up the Senate floor with a return to the contentious Obamacare debate. The more likely option is to attach it to another piece of legislation. Some Democrats are eyeing a year-end spending bill as an option. McConnell on Tuesday didn’t commit to the timing of a possible vote. “We haven't had a chance to think about the way forward yet,” he told reporters. Murray said Tuesday afternoon that it'll now be solely up to Senate Republican leaders to figure out what comes next. She and Alexander came up with the product. As for the process of getting it passed, she said, ""ask Mitch.""",Politico,,495,the framework which got immediate support from more democrats than republicans will need the lobbying muscle of the white house to win over skeptical republicans in congress. as part of the deal to reinstate the subsidies democrats agreed that states could allow a new catastrophic health plan a socalled copper plan along with the more generous gold silver and bronze that would cost less but still include the basic package of obamacare benefits. alexander and murray are trying to enact a bill that could have an effect on 2018 premiums the vast majority of which have already been set by insurance companies and approved by states.,"{'rouge1': Score(precision=0.9905660377358491, recall=0.08529650690495533, fmeasure=0.15706806282722513), 'rouge2': Score(precision=0.9619047619047619, recall=0.08211382113821138, fmeasure=0.15131086142322098), 'rougeL': Score(precision=0.9905660377358491, recall=0.08529650690495533, fmeasure=0.15706806282722513)}",0.15706806282722513,0.15131086142322098,0.15706806282722513

As for other Democratic contenders Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Sanders, the numbers reflect a foot race. For the moment, Quinnipiac University and Morning Consult polls signal that Biden winning in 2020 is now a plausible possibility. Beyond the obvious, Trump has reason to worry. If Biden is elected, Trump would become the Republican counterpart to Jimmy Carter, a one and done president who was shown the door after his party held the reins of power for just a single term. Beyond that, if Trump is out of office after the election next year, he may yet feel the sting of criminal indictment. That is certainly not the way most folks envision spending their golden years. However, let us not get too far ahead of things. Instead, let us look at the numbers, which do not augur well for the incumbent in a matchup against Biden, a son of the rustbelt and a man who wears his heart on his sleeve. Biden leads Trump by comfortable margins in Pennsylvania and Michigan, two states that Trump won in 2016, but that last went Republican in 1988. If those were the only two states to flip in 2020, neither candidate would possess a majority of electoral votes, and Trump would likely be reelected as the result of the presidential race being thrown over to the House of Representatives to decide. Trump and his minions could take solace in a second term and “owning the libs” as they see it. Beyond that, our national fissures would become deeper and more acrimonious. But that is not where the story ends, at least at this moment. Polls also show Biden leading in Texas by 4 points and in North Carolina by more than 10 points, and that is a very big deal. The Lone Star State last went Democratic when Carter squared off against Gerald Ford in 1976. As for the Tar Heel State, it too cast its lot with Carter back then, and it also lined up for Barack Obama in 2008. In other words, Biden has reason to smile. Still, he should not bask in glory too much or too soon. First, Biden faces the challenge of emerging as the Democratic nominee, and from the looks of things that outcome is far from a foregone conclusion. Biden leads the field nationally, as well as in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, which will host the first four nominating contests. Biden also appears to be at the top in Massachusetts, home to Elizabeth Warren. No matter what any Biden rival may say publicly, those are impressive stats. But early polls are no guarantee of ultimate success. In 2008, Hillary Clinton was the early favorite, until she was not. That same cycle, Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, went from the Republican front runner to one of the first candidates to exit the race. In 2016, there was the tale of woe told by Jeb Bush. Inevitability is fickle and fleeting. Beyond that stand, there are the numerous Democratic Party rules and constituencies. Unlike the Republicans, the Democrats bar “winner take all” primaries. Instead, delegates are awarded proportionally. Practically speaking, that opens the door to an elongated nominating season and to the possibility that the nomination will be decided until the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee next year. This leaves plenty of time for acrimony, demands, and grudges to accumulate and fester in the ranks. Finally, there are the Democrats themselves. Who they choose as their standard bearer will be linked by one degree or another to their policy preferences and demographics. How important is Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, and abortion to primary voters? How crucial is age to a party that nominated John Kennedy, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama? Then there are the debates. Bluntly, will Biden wilt under the heat of the stage lights or shrink in the face of likely attacks? Or will he dominate his competitors the way he schooled Paul Ryan in 2012? The bottom line is that Trump should not take anything for granted. He is loathed by many. As for Biden, it is too early to gloat. A lot can happen before next fall. Lloyd Green worked as the opposition research counsel to the George H.W.

the Democratic National Committee over a primary process they say is excluding them from debates but allowing a billionaire to buy his way on to the stage. California Sen. Kamala Harris’ abrupt departure from the 2020 race Tuesday has exposed the lack of diversity among the remaining group of top candidates. Despite falling from the top tier, Harris was the leading candidate of color and the only minority candidate to qualify for the Dec. 19 debate in Los Angeles. With her exit, prompted by a lack of financial resources to sustain a viable campaign, the current lineup of qualified debate participants are all white: Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Amy Klobuchar and Tom Steyer. Entrepreneur Andrew Yang and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, however, are on the cusp of making the cut.  The Booker and Castro campaigns say Harris’ announcement triggered an outpouring of financial support for them. Booker had the best online fundraising day of his campaign on Wednesday, and Castro had the best fundraising day of this quarter on Tuesday — he told reporters Thursday that his campaign has raised about $360,000 and crossed the 200,000-donor threshold since Harris dropped out. But that momentum is unlikely to earn them a lectern at the upcoming debate, as both candidates have little chance of reaching the 4 percent threshold in four approved polls before next Thursday’s deadline. At a campaign stop in Des Moines, Iowa, on Thursday morning, Booker opened his remarks by praising his “friend” Harris as a barrier-breaking politician whose candidacy he said inspired black youth. But at the same time, he blasted the system that he said caused her to end her campaign before a single vote was cast. “What message is that sending, that we heralded the most diverse field in our history, and now we’re seeing people like her dropping out of this campaign, not because Iowa voters had the voice?” Booker said. “Voters did not determine her destiny.” “I cannot tell you how much I believe in our primaries. And I’ve seen folk here in Iowa belie what all the predictions are and show us what real viability is,” Booker added, implicitly criticizing DNC rules that factor polling and grassroots fundraising into who can qualify for the debates. “It was this state that set a trajectory for the first black man in American history to become president — and, frankly, somebody that was way behind Hillary Clinton right now in the polls [at] that time.”  On a conference call with reporters Thursday afternoon to discuss the state of the presidential primary and Democratic debates, Castro also lauded Harris, calling her someone who ran a fantastic campaign and whose historic candidacy inspired millions. He suggested that the DNC improve the entire nomination process, including looking at new ways to evaluate a candidate’s support beyond polling and donors, and indicated that he was caught off guard when the party raised the thresholds for December’s debate. “I did not expect the DNC to raise the thresholds so close to the Iowa caucus, because when you get that close to the caucus, shouldn’t you just let the people vote?” Castro said. “You’re already within a couple months. Just let the folks vote. A lot of people out there feel that way.” Even Steyer, the billionaire environmentalist who has spent more than $60 million since launching his campaign in July, called for the DNC to “open the debate requirements for January so that more candidates can participate.” “One of the strengths of the Democratic Party is that it represents every community in our great nation,” he said in a statement Wednesday. “In order to defeat Donald Trump, Democrats need to engage voters from every part of the country, and that means making sure voters hear from a diverse group of candidates before they select our nominee.” For his part, Castro said he didn’t want an unfair “handout” that would put him on a debate stage this month that he didn’t qualify for — though he noted that the requirements for January’s debate and beyond haven’t been set, meaning the party wouldn’t be changing any rules for debate qualifications because the rules haven’t been written. Castro called for reforming the entire primary process, including the calendar, which begins with overwhelmingly white Iowa and New Hampshire, framing it as a more important task than any one candidate’s place on stage. Still, he added that he’s bothered by the effect that an all-white Democratic debate stage at this point in the race could have on the general election. “I’m worried that if we have a debate stage without any … racial or ethnic diversity on it, that we’re putting ourselves at a greater risk for failure in November of 2020,” he said. Despite the criticism from candidates, no campaigns have recommended an alternative set of criteria for debates.  In a statement to POLITICO, the DNC defended its process, which allowed up to 20 candidates to participate in the first two set of debates and has had at least 10 candidates on every stage so far. “This has been the most inclusive debate process with more women and candidates of color participating in more debates than billionaires,” DNC spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa said. “While we are legally required to have objective criteria for each debate, our qualifying criteria has stayed extremely low throughout this entire process.”  December’s qualification criteria included having 200,000 unique donors and at least 4 percent support in four approved polls. “Nobody who has failed to reach 4 percent at this point in the race has gone on to be the nominee, and our debate criteria reflects that,” Hinojosa said. “In addition, we have made diversity a priority by requiring that every debate have women and people of color as moderators. We’ve never seen a political party take this many steps to be inclusive.” Booker, whose campaign has shifted resources in a so-far failed effort to boost his polling numbers, made a direct plea Thursday. “I’m here to ask for your support,” he told the audience, who applauded and briefly chanted “Cory! Cory!” “Hold on, let me be more blunt: I’m asking you when your caller ID is showing that some pollster’s calling you, pick up the phone and answer, please. Choose me. Choose us.”",Politico,,530,in order to defeat donald trump democrats need to engage voters from every part of the country and that means making sure voters hear from a diverse group of candidates before they select our nominee for his part castro said he didnt want an unfair handout that would put him on a debate stage this month that he didnt qualify for though he noted that the requirements for januarys debate and beyond havent been set meaning the party wouldnt be changing any rules for debate qualifications because the rules havent been written. while we are legally required to have objective criteria for each debate our qualifying criteria has stayed extremely low throughout this entire process decembers qualification criteria included having 200000 unique donors and at least percent support in four approved polls.,"{'rouge1': Score(precision=0.9545454545454546, recall=0.11655874190564293, fmeasure=0.2077493816982688), 'rouge2': Score(precision=0.8778625954198473, recall=0.10648148148148148, fmeasure=0.18992568125516104), 'rougeL': Score(precision=0.9545454545454546, recall=0.11655874190564293, fmeasure=0.2077493816982688)}",0.2077493816982688,0.18992568125516104,0.2077493816982688

The Carlson book looks at the strange, almost comical visit by Nikita Khrushchev to the United States in the 1950s at the beginning of the Cold War. The Browder book recounts his and his former lawyer Sergei Magnitsky’s experience in Russia in the 1990s-2000s as it began to privatize economic sectors, moving from communism to an oligarch-dominated dictatorship. The similarities, despite the political and economic changes, are striking.” What’s a trend going on in the U.S. or abroad that doesn’t get enough attention? “I’ve written or talked about this topic often -- the disconnect between government representatives and their constituents is troubling. We’ve had an artificial limit on the number of House members elected that was set 100 years ago. Every 10 years, we have a census that tells us how many people are living in our country and we move the deck chairs around where states that aren’t growing as fast as other states are losing representation. We need to increase the number of seats in the House to account for the population increases and shifts that have occurred over the last century.” How’s the Trump presidency going? “See this past week for the highlights -- impeachment and State of the Union -- Washington is more partisan and ugly than I ever remember it being.” What’s a fun fact that people in Washington might not know about you? “I think for a lot of people who went to a nice college and have been in Washington for a while -- the assumption is that we started on third base with a lead.

The guest writer of today’s newsletter is Bari Weiss, an editor and writer in the Opinion section. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. “I don’t want to be alarmist, but we’re all going to die.” That’s the sunny sentiment Stephen Colbert opened his show with on Tuesday evening, after a day in which the American president promised North Korea that if it continued to threaten the United States the Hermit Kingdom would be “met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.” Remember Hillary’s line? In my view, it summed up the best argument against voting for Donald Trump: “A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.” As we’ve learned over the past six months, we can’t even trust him with his own mouth. The threat Mr. Trump issued was entirely improvised, according to Times reporters. But for the vast majority of Americans who still believe that words have meaning, the president’s ad-lib was “alarming,” as Evelyn N. Farkas rightly points out in The Times, “since the world has witnessed the horror of atomic bombs used by the United States on Japan at the end of World War II.” So what can be done? Do we East Coasters need to send for our friends and family in California and Alaska (not to mention Guam and Seoul)? Susan Rice, a former Obama advisor, argues in our pages that it’s not too late for the U.S. to reduce the threat of North Korean nuclear weapons. “While we quietly continue to refine our military options, we can rely on traditional deterrence by making crystal clear that any use of nuclear weapons against the United States or its allies would result in annihilation of North Korea,” she writes. In other words, more of the same. Or in other other words: There is no good solution. That’s the overwhelming (and terrifying) consensus offered by various Pyongyang watchers. The most comprehensive of these is the Atlantic cover story this month by Mark Bowden. Best to read his piece with a stiff drink. ** If you aren’t cowering under your desk, consider reading this short piece I wrote about Dwayne Betts. When Betts was 16 years old, he was sentenced to nine years in prison for a carjacking. “I don’t have any illusions that the penitentiary is going to help you, but you can get something out of it if you want to,” said the judge who meted out the sentence. Doubtful that judge could have imagined that Betts would go on to earn a degree from Yale Law School. The father of two is exactly the kind of lawyer the Connecticut bar should be celebrating. Instead, it’s denied him admission. What does his case say about our criminal justice system? On the news. Rex Tillerson’s efforts to downplay the president’s rhetoric won’t relax tensions with North Korea, argues The Atlantic’s Krishnadev Calamur. “The secretary of state might assure the U.S. public that he has the issue covered and that they can indeed ‘sleep well at night,’ but it’s Trump’s words that are being heard in Pyongyang and the rest of the world.” Raiding former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort’s home for documents suggests that Robert Mueller’s Russia probe “has advanced, has identified specific potential crimes, and is zeroing in on key evidence,” Alex Whiting writes in Just Security. “It should now be plain that Mueller will use all the investigative tools at his disposal to fulfill the task that he has been assigned.” David Leonhardt, the regular author of this newsletter, will return Aug. 28.

kasolowsky,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel’s parliament passed an amendment on Tuesday that would make it harder for it to cede control over parts of Jerusalem in any peace deal with the Palestinians, who condemned the move as undermining any chance to revive talks on statehood.  The legislation, sponsored by the far-right Jewish Home coalition party, raises to 80 from 61 the number of votes required in the 120-seat Knesset to approve any proposal to hand over part of the city to “a foreign party”.  Last month U.S. President Donald Trump angered the Palestinians, Middle East leaders and world powers by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.   As home to major Muslim, Jewish and Christian holy sites, Jerusalem’s status is one of the most sensitive issues in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Trump’s Dec. 6 decision sparked regional protests and prompted the Palestinians to rule out Washington as a peace broker in any future talks.  Nabil Abu Rdainah, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, described Trump’s policy shift on Jerusalem and the passage of the amendment as “a declaration of war against the Palestinian people”.  “The vote clearly shows that the Israeli side has officially declared an end to the so-called political process,” Abu Rdainah said, referring to U.S.-sponsored talks on Palestinian statehood that collapsed in 2014.  Israel captured East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed it in a move not recognized internationally. It says the entire city is its “eternal and indivisible” capital.  Palestinians seek to make East Jerusalem the capital of a state they seek to establish in the occupied West Bank and in the Gaza Strip.  The amendment, long in the legislative pipeline, was passed with 64 lawmakers voting in favor and 52 against.  Opposition head Isaac Herzog said Jewish Home was leading  Israel “toward a terrible disaster”. Jewish Home’s leader, Naftali Bennett, said the vote showed that Israel would keep control of all of Jerusalem forever.  “There will be no more political skulduggery that will allow our capital to be torn apart,” Bennett said on Twitter.  A bid to revive Israeli-Palestinian negotiations led by the president’s adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has so far shown no progress.  On Sunday, Netanyahu’s Likud party unanimously urged legislators in a non-binding resolution to effectively annex Israeli settlements built in the West Bank. [L8N1OV0GP]  Political commentators said Likud’s decision might bolster right-wing support for Netanyahu, who could seek a public mandate in an early election while he awaits possible criminal indictments against him on corruption suspicions. He denies wrongdoing.   Parliamentary elections are not due until November 2019 but the police investigations in two cases of alleged corruption against Netanyahu and tensions among coalition partners in his government could hasten a poll.  Some commentators, pointing to an existing law that already sets a similar high threshold for handing over territory in a land-for-peace deal, have said Jewish Home was essentially competing with Likud for support among the right-wing base.

The Associated Press reports U.S. District Judge Andre Birotte Jr. on Friday ordered Jeffrey Yohai to pay $6.7 million in restitution for his crimes along with the prison sentence. “This is an individual who has an evil mind — I don’t know how else to say it,” the judge said. “It seems he felt he could do whatever he wants - but that buck stops here,” Birotte Jr. said, according to the news outlet. Yohai pleaded guilty to various fraud schemes, including renting out luxury homes without the permission of their owners, selling non-existent backstage passes for the Coachella music festival and pawning band equipment that belonged to someone else, the AP noted.

The actor and his son invested in a real estate project after prodding from Yohai, who instead used their money to pay off debts and for personal expenses. Hoffman reportedly lost roughly $3 million. “Defendant has done tremendous damage to a huge number of victims,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Brown wrote in a court filing. Yohai “has shown an almost unbelievable compulsion to defraud others, to the point that he could not stop even while awaiting this court’s judgment on him in the first case, which strongly suggests that he will continue on his criminal path despite having been blessed with so many advantages.” Prosecutors, who noted that Yohai’s scams brought in more than $13 million, asked that he receive a 15-year prison term.

The House's Office of General Counsel filed a motion in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Monday arguing for an expedited decision on the lawsuit that seeks to enforce a subpoena for McGahn’s testimony. Democrats hope that if they win on the McGahn subpoena, it would trigger a domino effect and compel other reluctant witnesses to testify. They hope their testimonies could spark a new wave of support for impeachment. And while the timing could take months, this effort comes at a critical time for the party.

As former special counsel Robert Mueller's report is fading from the political conversation, Pelosi has continued to favor focusing on a Democratic agenda while continuing investigations in the House. On Friday, Pelosi cautioned that impeachment lacks public support. “The public isn’t there on impeachment,” she told Democrats during a caucuswide conference call, according to a source on the call. “It’s your voice and constituency, but give me the leverage I need to make sure that we’re ready and it is as strong as it can be.” Nadler is facing pressure from members of his panel, a majority of whom support an inquiry, and he represents a New York district where constituents are likely to back an aggressive impeachment effort. If his committee is able to puncture some holes in the White House armor with its subpoenas, Pelosi could come under new pressure to back impeachment. Pelosi's office, asked about the coming showdown, said the Speaker supports Nadler's investigations. Nadler has issued subpoenas for former Trump campaign manager Corey LewandowskiCorey R. LewandowskiNadler files motion to expedite lawsuit seeking McGahn testimony Nadler subpoenas former White House aide Rob Porter Sunday shows - Recession fears dominate MORE and former White House officials Rob Porter and Rick Dearborn to testify at a joint hearing on Sept. 17. All three are tied to a key episode of possible obstruction by Trump described in Mueller’s report. Lewandowski, who has never served in the Trump administration and therefore is outside the White House’s current claims of immunity, has publicly stated that he will testify before the committee but that he would do so with the goal of throwing punches for the president. “I am an open book. I want to go and remind the American people that these guys are on a witch hunt, right?” Lewandowski, who is considering a New Hampshire Senate run, told Fox News Radio earlier this month. Porter and Dearborn are likely to face pressure from the Trump administration not to testify. The White House has successfully blocked other subpoenaed administration officials from testifying. One Judiciary committee source, asked about the likelihood of Porter and Dearborn testifying, replied, “We are hopeful, but I am not sure how realistic that is.” The White House has argued that under the standard of immunity, confidentiality protections offered to the executive branch apply to current and former aides. This effectively prevents them from disclosing what took place during their time in the administration, the White House contends. While both Republican and Democratic administrations have invoked the immunity concept, legal experts say there is virtually no case law on the subject. Some predict the White House is likely to lose if it's challenged in court. It is far from clear when a decision will be made in the McGahn lawsuit that seeks to both challenge the White House claims of immunity and obtain testimony from the former White House counsel. “Even if this is expedited, I would be surprised if we had a final ruling — and that includes the final appeals courts — before the new year,” Elie Honig, a former federal prosecutor, said of the McGahn case. While Nadler has said he has tried to give reasonable accommodations to witnesses before turning to the courts, Honig noted that the committee will also have to make its case for why the court should expedite a decision in the McGahn lawsuit, particularly since Democrats have not appeared to move quickly on the matter themselves. “It is kind of hard to tell a court this version that we need to expedite when it has been three months since they subpoenaed McGahn and three weeks since they filed the lawsuit against McGahn,” Honig told The Hill.  Nadler and other House Democrats backing impeachment hope a hearing with Porter, Lewandowski and Dearborn will highlight Trump’s conduct after he learned he was under investigation by Mueller for possibly obstructing his investigation of Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election. According to the Mueller report, the president asked Lewandowski to deliver a message to then-Attorney General Jeff SessionsJefferson (Jeff) Beauregard SessionsFederal prosecutors to seek death penalty in Pittsburgh synagogue shooting case A better way to run the Federal Bureau of Prisons Trump admin erases key environmental enforcement tool MORE asking him to reverse his decision to recuse himself from the Russia probe, a request that came two days after Trump ordered McGahn to remove the special counsel. McGahn refused to carry out the order. Lewandowski, who did not “want to deliver the President’s message personally,” instead asked Dearborn to deliver a message dictated by the president to Sessions, the report says. Dearborn did not follow through with the request, telling investigators it made him feel “uncomfortable.” And after reports about Trump’s removal requests were reported in the news, the president ordered Porter to tell McGahn to create a false record that would contradict the former White House counsel’s account, the reports says. While Republicans have accused Democrats of rehashing the Mueller report, Democrats say this is a clear example of Trump interfering in Mueller’s probe and that the American people should hear about the episode firsthand from the witnesses involved.

Hillary Clinton's embattled top aide returned to the trail Monday night, following a disappearance while she was at the center of a new email imbroglio. Abedin was spotted for the first time in over a week boarding the ""Stronger Together"" plane, after a 33,000-person rally with Bruce Springsteen and the Obamas at Independence Hall in Philadelphia. The longtime bodywoman, who now serves as vice chairwoman of Clinton's campaign, landed her boss in FBI director James Comey's sights again, 11 days before the election. Comey announced on Oct. 28 that the agency was reviewing new emails in the old Clinton email probe that were discovered in a separate investigation of Abedin's estranged husband Anthony Weiner's alleged sexting with a 15-year-old girl. Weiner has since been photographed on horseback at a rehab facility. The October surprise threatened to change the course of the election in the final stretch, and gave Donald Trump some hope of reversing the downward trajectory of his own campaign.  On Sunday afternoon, the door seemed to close on that possibility. Comey announced he had concluded the new emails discovered on Weiner's confiscated laptop did not change his July ruling that Clinton did not intentionally mishandle classified messages through her private server. Abedin didn't totally hibernate during her hiatus from Clinton's side.

only recently from a public defender that her arrest record could be expunged  for 500 in fees. ms wills does not have the extra cash and ms marshall has no way to earn it,"NEW ORLEANS — When Chené Marshall got into a fight in high school, she assumed she might be suspended. Instead, the police arrested her. Then a 17-year-old junior with no criminal record, she did not realize that Louisiana was in the dwindling minority of states where all 17-year-olds are treated as adults by the criminal justice system. She was charged with battery, with bail set at $5,000. She was booked and clothed in a jumpsuit at the Orleans Parish Prison, a notoriously violent facility where she bunked along with women of all ages and histories. “I had a fight that first night,” she recalled of her jailing in 2011. “It’s called ‘testing your weight,’ to see if you’re scared or they can own you.” She spent three nights in the jail before her great-aunt, who had raised her from infancy, could come up with a bondsman’s $650 fee and secure her release. Seventeen-year-olds cannot vote, buy cigarettes or even adopt a dog from an animal shelter. But as of today, in nine states, including Louisiana, they are automatically handled as adults, rather than as juveniles. In two states, New York and North Carolina, 16-year-olds are as well. Now Louisiana and several other states among those nine appear to be on the verge of raising the cutoff to the more standard age of 18 — part of a national “raise the age” movement that has won bipartisan support, a result of concern about high incarceration rates and growing neurological evidence that young people’s brains are different from adult brains. A bill to phase in the higher age passed the Republican-dominated Louisiana Senate on May 2, has the strong support of Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, and now appears to be moving forward in the House. A similar measure appears to be on the verge of adoption by the South Carolina Legislature. Here in Louisiana, the change could alter the lives of close to 5,000 17-year-olds who are arrested each year, mainly for nonviolent misdemeanors. Under the new law, even if they were given prolonged stays in juvenile facilities, they could receive therapy and a chance for high school degrees rather than criminal records and exposure to hardened criminals. To allay concerns that the state’s juvenile system, already caught in a severe budget crisis, is not prepared for an influx, the bill would phase in the change, with nonviolent offenders making the switch in 2018, and the rest in 2020, said Josh Perry, executive director of the Louisiana Center for Children’s Rights, which provides public defenders for children and has lobbied for the bill. As in other states, prosecutors would retain the option to transfer juveniles who commit particularly serious crimes into adult courts. In the peak “tough on crime” years of the 1990s, many states acted to send more young offenders to adult courts. But in the last seven years, Illinois and Connecticut increased the age for automatic treatment as adults to 18 from 16, and Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Mississippi raised it to 18 from 17. The experience in those states has bolstered the case for change, said Vincent Schiraldi, a senior research fellow in criminal justice at Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government and a former justice official in New York City and Washington, D.C. While the declining crime rate makes comparisons difficult, evidence suggests that treating 17-year-old offenders as juveniles may reduce public costs over time, he said, because they are less likely to commit future crimes than youths who are punished as adults. Fears that crime would rise or detention facilities would be overwhelmed have proved incorrect. Officials in Connecticut, Illinois and Vermont are even discussing raising the cutoff to 21, though this is more widely disputed. In New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has proposed raising the age for adult culpability to 18, but members of the Republican-controlled Senate have expressed concerns about transitional costs as well as public safety. In Lafayette, La., Rob Reardon, the director of corrections for the parish, explained why he thought that both the state and the young offenders would be helped by treating 17-year-olds as juveniles. “This is an adult jail,” he said, “and the outcomes for the young people just have to be terrible.” On a recent day, the parish jail held one female and eight male 17-year-olds, awaiting adjudication for crimes that ranged from trespassing to murder. When they spend a few weeks in his jail, Mr. Reardon said — and for those who cannot make bail, it is often 90 days or more — youths are expelled from school and never graduate. The presence of 17-year-olds is also a major resource strain, he said. Inmates generally live in pods of 13 cells with double bunks, or 26 to a pod. According to a federal law (one that has frequently been violated in New Orleans), youths must be kept separate, so one entire pod was occupied by just the eight 17-year-old boys, who were tended 24 hours a day by a guard. The 17-year-old girl was housed alone in a unit with four cells. The separation also means that the youngest inmates cannot take part in activities like kitchen work. In the youth pod in Lafayette, guards had brought in coloring books and jigsaw puzzles to give the boys something to do. In New Orleans, Ms. Marshall, now 22, was lucky in some ways after her arrest. A judge allowed her to enter a diversion program; if she attended an anger management class, stayed drug free and continued in school, the criminal charge would be dropped. She finished high school the next year. But now, five years later, she still lives with her great-aunt, Yolanda Wills, in east New Orleans, where a mantel in their home is filled with Ms. Marshall’s high school athletic trophies. Ms. Wills, a retired school bus driver living on disability, said she was taken aback when the police arrested Ms. Marshall and then was frustrated by what followed. “They said that if she goes through the program, they’d clear her record,” Ms. Wills said. “But it didn’t go anywhere,” she said. What Ms. Wills and Ms. Marshall did not realize was that, while the criminal charge disappeared, the arrest record remained. Ms. Marshall said that because of that record, she has repeatedly been turned down for jobs — as a superstore clerk, as a security guard and as a postal worker, among others. She learned only recently from a public defender that her arrest record could be expunged — for $500 in fees. Ms. Wills does not have the extra cash, and Ms. Marshall has no way to earn it. “I can’t pay to expunge the record, and I can’t get a job to get the money,” she said.
